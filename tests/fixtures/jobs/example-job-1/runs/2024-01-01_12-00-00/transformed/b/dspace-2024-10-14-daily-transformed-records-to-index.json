      "The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) has confirmed that X-ray polarimetry is a valuable tool in astronomy, providing critical insights into the emission processes and the geometry of compact objects. IXPE was designed to be sensitive in the 2\u20138 keV energy range for three primary reasons: (1) celestial X-ray sources are bright within this range, (2) the optics are effective, and (3) most sources across various classes were expected to exhibit some level of polarization. Indeed, IXPE is a great success, and its discoveries are necessitating the revision of many theoretical models for numerous sources. However, one of IXPE\u2019s main limitations is its relatively narrow energy band, coupled with rapidly declining efficiency. In this paper, we will demonstrate the benefits of devising a mission focused on a broader energy band (0.1\u201379 keV). This approach leverages current technologies that align well with theoretical expectations and builds on the successes of IXPE."

      "HfSe2 and ZrSe2 transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) films are of interest for their potential applications in field-effect transistors. To implement the use of these materials in devices, the formation of an oxide/TMD interface with well-defined dielectric/semiconductor properties is essential. The method by which the oxide is created, as well as any structural changes in the TMD under the conditions used for oxide formation, will affect the performance of both the dielectric and the semiconductor. In this work, we describe the structure of the oxide and the morphological changes occurring in HfSe2 and ZrSe2 under several oxidation conditions. Using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we show that room temperature oxidation in air causes segregation of Se and uneven surface oxidation. Exposure to O2 at high temperatures readily forms a crystalline oxide layer, although defects and cavities are also detectable. Finally, plasma oxidation forms a smoother and more uniform oxide layer than that formed by thermal oxidation. These results can guide the rational design of oxide/TMD interfaces for field-effect transistors and other electronic devices that incorporate HfSe2 and ZrSe2."

      "In the governance of the shared mobility market of a city or of a metropolitan area, there are two conflicting principles: 1) the healthy competition between multiple platforms, such as between Uber and Lyft in the United States, and 2) economies of network scale, which leads to higher chances for trips to be matched, and thus higher operation efficiency, but which also implies monopoly. The current shared mobility markets, as observed in different cities in the world, are either monopolistic, or largely segmented by multiple platforms, the latter with significant efficiency loss. How to keep the competition between platforms, but to reduce the efficiency loss due to segmentation with new market designs is the focus of this paper. We first propose a theoretical framework of shared mobility market segmentation and then propose four market structure designs thereupon. The framework and four designs are first discussed as an abstract model, without losing generality, thus not constrained to any specific city. High-level perspectives and detailed mechanisms for each proposed market structure are both examined. Then, to assess the real-world performance of these market structure designs, we used a ride-sharing simulator with real-world ride-hailing trip data from New York City to simulate. The proposed market designs can reduce the total vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) by 6\\% while serving more customers with 8.4\\% fewer total number of trips. In the meantime, customers receive better services with on-average 5.4\\% shorter waiting time. At the end of the paper, the feasibility of implementation for each proposed market structure is discussed."

      "A study of the anomalous couplings of the Higgs boson to vector bosons, including CP\r\n-violation effects, has been conducted using its production and decay in the WW channel. This analysis is performed on proton\u2013proton collision data collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC during 2016\u20132018 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 138fb\u22121\r\n. The different-flavor dilepton (e\u03bc)\r\n final state is analyzed, with dedicated categories targeting gluon fusion, electroweak vector boson fusion, and associated production with a W or Z boson. Kinematic information from associated jets is combined using matrix element techniques to increase the sensitivity to anomalous effects at the production vertex. A simultaneous measurement of four Higgs boson couplings to electroweak vector bosons is performed in the framework of a standard model effective field theory. All measurements are consistent with the expectations for the standard model Higgs boson and constraints are set on the fractional contribution of the anomalous couplings to the Higgs boson production cross section."
