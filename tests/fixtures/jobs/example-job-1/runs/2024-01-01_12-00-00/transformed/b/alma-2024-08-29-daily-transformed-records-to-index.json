      "In 2023, a series of atmospheric rivers reawakened California's largest sleeping lake, Pa'ashi, in the California Tulare Lake Basin. This thesis supports the proposal of the Tachi Yokut Tribe, one of the watershed's Indigenous communities, to preserve Pa'ashi in the form of a new National Park. I present historical and environmental context that explains how the lake was put to sleep by Manifest Destiny-era agricultural settlement and subsequent consolidation of political control over water. I argue that the Tachi Yokut Tribe's proposal for a National Park is a pragmatic, feasible, and desirable planning response to the region's interwoven challenges of climate change, ecological imbalance, and pervasive environmental injustice. I demonstrate how the community might develop the ideas of the park further through a sample visioning process and landscape design framework for the watershed. This thesis advances a theory of \"two-eyed seeing\" (Bartlett et al 2012) planning practice by centering Indigenous values and planning scholarship to articulate how planners and designers might foster stronger connections between people, place, and nature when undertaking landscape-scale climate adaptation projects."

      "This thesis explores the paths forward at the intersection of economic development, public space, and parking. Using OpenStreetMap data and American Community Survey estimates, this project uses GIS analysis to develop a typology of contemporary NFL stadium developments. Using illustrative case studies informed by this analysis, site visits, and pre-existing literature, the thesis evaluates the tradeoffs presented by various approaches to stadium development. Rather than recommend a single path forward, this thesis provides suggestions for working within the constraints of local landscapes to develop strategies to best support the public good in each context."

      "The increasing multitude of powerful data analytic tools in recent years has motivated the development of smart data analytics approaches, i.e. a decision tree based super algorithm that automatically selects the most suitable method based on a systematic interrogation of the dataset. This work introduces two different smart data analytics approaches for the objectives of supervised classification and fault detection, as they arise for example in the context of process monitoring schemes for chemical manufacturing processes. For both objectives, a visual representation of the method selection process is presented in form of a data analytics triangle. The necessary interrogation framework for the model selection process is introduced and the overall approaches for both objectives are demonstrated in case studies showing great performance over a variety of different supervised classification and fault detection problems. Additionally, predictive modeling techniques are applied to industrial endto-end biomanufacturing datasets for two monoclonal antibody products to predict critical quality attributes. Different approaches are introduced to consider both secondorder and third-order tensorial data combined as possible inputs to the predictive modeling. It is shown that the utilization of the proposed methods is capable of significantly improving the prediction performance if the dataset is analyzed correctly beforehand. Moreover, the ability to predict and classify the cycle life of LiNiMnCo (NMC) battery half-cells based on acoustic measurements capturing degradation events such as grain fracture and gas formation in combination with prior introduced data analytical methods is demonstrated. Lastly, the application of a Kalman Filter model to predict moats around companies in the stock market is explored."

      "The buyout of homes that have undergone significant cumulative flood damage, or are poised to do so, is an increasingly relied upon tool used by government agencies, including the New Jersey Department of Environmental (NJDEP) Protection Blue Acres Program, to adapt within the arena of accelerating climate change. Buyouts act primarily as a form of climate adaptation; residents voluntarily move away from areas of high flood risk and are equipped generally with the market value of their former homes to find safer housing, while the former homes are demolished and made into open space. The post-buyout process, which is where social and financial consequences crystallize materially, forms the focus of this thesis study. In the case of Blue Acres, much effort is made to guide participants towards eligible incentives or supplemental relocation assistance on top of their appraisal value, which requires relocating outside of a flood zone and/or within the same community. Additionally, Blue Acres has established itself within a larger network of community organizations and other state agencies that it can point participants to for disaster recovery relief and housing counseling. Nevertheless, its post-buyout process has potential to make concrete many of the improvements that buyout scholars across the U.S. advise, further strengthening its role as a national pioneer in managed retreat. I propose five recommendations based on this literature: establishing a tracking system of outcomes, creating a low-income homeowners relocation incentive, expanding on the Smart Move pilot program, involving former and remaining residents to decide how bought-out land in their neighborhood is used, and collaborating with municipalities to bring buyouts into their long-range adaptation planning. These form the basis of my question: How can Blue Acres strengthen the post-buyout branch of its services to ensure better long-term social and financial outcomes for its participating homeowners? Keywords: Flood, buyouts, climate adaptation, climate resilience, municipal finance, local government, housing, land use, community engagement"
