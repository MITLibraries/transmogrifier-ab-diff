    "This study aims to enhance the understanding of self-loosening in mesoscale bolt assemblies, specifically those with characteristic dimensions ranging from 100 to 3,000 micrometers. These bolts pose unique design challenges due to the small difference between their nominal dimensions and manufacturing tolerances. This work discusses the design of new instrumentation to test multimesoscale bolt assemblies under various loading conditions, an area previously focused only on larger bolts. A case study was conducted in collaboration with a mesoscale multi-bolt system that was experiencing self-loosening failures. This system was tested to determine its susceptibility to the self-loosening failure mode. An experimental study was conducted to identify the sensitivities of the system to geometric and loading environment parameters. A set of hypotheses were proposed as a way to facilitate new learnings about the system\u2019s sensitivities to four different parameters. The findings from the experimental study provide valuable insights into how different geometric configurations and types of loading conditions contribute to the performance of mesoscale multi-bolted systems. Through these investigative efforts, the study successfully identified the existence of a critical displacement threshold for self-loosening in mesoscale multi-bolted systems that is sensitive to factors such as clamp length, amplitude of input displacement load, and screw position."

    "The Fiber Extrusion Device (FrED) is an affordable desktop tool intended for engineering education. It mimics the fiber draw process, allowing students to study topics such as data acquisition, control systems, computer vision, data analytics, and smart manufacturing. As an educational tool, the goal of the device is to replicate the practical laboratory experience in remote learning scenarios. FrED has gone through multiple iterations, yet several outstanding issues remain. Building on the 2023 team\u2019s progress, the 2024 project objectives include refining the design, developing controls, scaling up manufacturing, designing the assembly line, managing inventory, creating educational content, and conducting user testing and pilot runs. This thesis specifically details the author\u2019s contributions to enhancing mechanical designs, advancing control systems, increasing production capacity, and planning educational materials. Mechanical components in the frame, the cooling system, and the diameter measurement system were redesigned to improve stiffness and stability. Local PID controllers were implemented for the DC motor and heater, effectively closing the feedback loop for fiber diameter control. The production target of manufacturing 35 FrED units was successfully achieved within the planned timeframe, with the packaging design optimized for efficient shipping. Additionally, an assembly manual, a graphical user interface, and control activities were developed as part of the educational content. Three user testing sessions were conducted to gather feedback."

    "In the era of hardware specialization, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) provide a promising platform for computer architects, combining the programmability of software with the speed and performance of hardware. Despite this, compiling hardware programs onto FPGAs can be incredibly time-consuming, making it hard to develop and iterate on complex FPGA programs. Of particular relevance is the routing phase, which takes a circuit\u2019s technology-mapped netlist and routes its signals using the switches and wires present on a given FPGA architecture, often with a target of minimizing critical path delay. This optimization problem is known to be NP-hard, and existing algorithms for approximating it exhibit very little regular parallelism.\r\nThis thesis accelerates the routing phase of VTR 8.0, a commonly used, open-source research tool for FPGA CAD flow. We show that despite the lack of regular parallelism, routing still exhibits significant irregular parallelism. This parallelism can be exploited on parallel architectures that provide hardware support for ordered tasks and fine-grained speculation, such as the Swarm architecture. Using Swarm, we exploit the parallelism present at the core of VTR\u2019s algorithm, achieving a 35.9x speedup on a single routing iteration of a large benchmark (cholesky_mc) on 256 cores."

    "In the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions, this thesis explores the lifecycle emissions and economic feasibility of geologic hydrogen production. This research extends Brandt's 2023 study of 'prospective' lifecycle assessment (LCA), enhancing the underlying open-source LCA model used in this work and adding a preliminary techno-economic analysis (TEA). The findings demonstrate that geologic hydrogen developments should have emissions intensities that compare favourably to all other hydrogen production pathways. The value of lifetime emissions intensity for Brandt\u2019s Baseline case is estimated at 0.40 kgCO2e/kgH2, representing an increase of ~6% over Brandt\u2019s estimation. The study also highlights the potential for geologic hydrogen to achieve competitive levelized costs (estimated at $1.45/kg), making it a promising candidate in the hydrogen economy. It finds that to achieve the best possible emissions and economic results, proponents of geologic hydrogen developments should seek to maximise the productivity of each well. It also studies the impact of the United States regime of production tax credits for hydrogen, finding that the fivefold increase in the magnitude of credits for meeting employment conditions is generally more impactful than lowering emissions intensity. The thesis underscores the importance of continued refinement of LCA and TEA models to understand geologic hydrogen resources better and ensure they are developed appropriately."

    "This thesis explores the implementation of Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) technologies, focusing on the stages of capture, transportation, and sequestration. Utilizing a system dynamics model, the research evaluates CCS's effectiveness and economic viability across various scenarios, including those outlined by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The baseline model suggests that even under favorable assumptions, CCS permanently sequesters only a small fraction of total global emissions.\r\n\r\nThe economic analysis reveals a slight decrease in total costs, attributed to the learning curve, but offset by increasing costs as more complex projects are undertaken. The model also highlights the energy penalty associated with high energy requirements for capture. Additionally, the alignment of capacities across capture, transportation, and sequestration phases is important because discrepancies can lead to inefficiencies and bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nThis research acknowledges limitations, including the use of aggregated data and assumptions across many parameters. These limitations emphasize the need for further research to refine these estimates and enhance the model's accuracy. Despite these challenges, the model serves as a beneficial tool for testing policy interventions and assessing the potential of CCS as a component of global climate strategy.\r\n\r\nOverall, the findings highlight the complexities and challenges of deploying CCS technologies at scale, emphasizing the importance of coordinated policy, technological innovation, and infrastructure development. This research provides a foundation for future studies and policy discussions to better understand CCS's role in achieving climate goals.\r\n\r\nDisclosure: The following content is the author\u2019s, and responsibility is taken for all content.

    "Precisely estimating lumen boundaries in intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is needed for sizing interventional stents to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Unfortunately, current segmentation networks like the UNet lack the precision required for clinical adoption in IVUS workflows. This arises due to the difficulty of automatically learning accurate lumen contour from limited training data while accounting for the radial geometry of IVUS imaging. We propose the Geo-UNet framework to address these issues via a design informed by the geometry of the lumen contour segmentation task, building anatomical constraints directly into the architecture. We first convert the input data and segmentation targets from Cartesian to polar coordinates. Starting from a convUNet feature extractor, we propose a two-task setup, one for conventional pixel-wise labeling and the other for single boundary lumen-contour localization. We directly combine the two predictions by passing the predicted lumen contour through a new activation (named CDFeLU) to filter out spurious pixel-wise predictions. Our unified loss function carefully balances area-based, distance-based, and contour-based penalties to provide near clinical-grade generalization in unseen patient data. We also introduce a lightweight, inference-time technique to enhance segmentation smoothness. The efficacy of our framework on a venous IVUS dataset is shown against state-of-the-art models. We will make the code repository for this project available soon after approval from industry collaborators."

    "This thesis investigates the psychological factors that influence belief in AI predictions, comparing them to belief in astrology- and personality-based predictions, and examines the \"personal validation effect\" in the context of AI, particularly with Large Language Models (LLMs). Through two interconnected studies involving 238 participants, the first study explores how cognitive style, paranormal beliefs, AI attitudes, and personality traits impact perceptions of the validity, reliability, usefulness, and personalization of predictions from different sources. The study finds a positive correlation between belief in AI predictions and belief in astrology- and personality-based predictions, highlighting a \"rational superstition\" phenomenon where belief is more influenced by mental heuristics and intuition than by critical evaluation. Interestingly, cognitive style did not significantly affect belief in predictions, while paranormal beliefs, positive AI attitudes, and conscientiousness played significant roles. The second study reveals that positive predictions are perceived as significantly more valid, personalized, reliable, and useful than negative ones, emphasizing the strong influence of prediction valence on user perceptions. This underscores the need for AI systems to manage user expectations and foster balanced trust. The thesis concludes with a proposal for future research on how belief in AI predictions influences actual user behavior, exploring it through the lens of self-fulfilling prophecy. Overall, this thesis enhances understanding of human-AI interaction and provides insights for developing AI systems across various applications."

    "In the era of digital transformation, Accounting and Finance (A&F) functions face the challenge of making well-informed decisions about which technologies to adopt, which processes to prioritize, and why. These decisions require stakeholders to carefully evaluate available options, assess their implications and tradeoffs, and align diverse preferences to make well-supported investment choices. Conducting this process in a siloed and unstructured manner can lead to inefficiencies.\r\nThis study explores the application of Systems Thinking (ST) and Systems Engineering (SE) methods, developing an integrated framework that combines Rich Picture, Object-Process Diagram (OPD), Design Structure Matrix (DSM), and Multi-attribute Tradespace Exploration (MATE) to enhance the technology adoption decision-making process within A&F functions. The focus is on Internal Audit (IA) as a case study for a simplified model and demonstration. While empirical data collection and hypothesis testing were not conducted due to data and time constraints, qualitative insights were gathered from industry practitioners.\r\nKey findings suggest that the integrated framework can potentially reduce the time and effort needed to reach technology adoption decisions. Providing a structured and comprehensive approach ensures that the decision-making process is more holistic, unbiased, and quantifiable. This can also offer post-implementation benefits, as the technologies adopted align better with the organization\u2019s requirements and preferences, resulting in improved efficiency and effectiveness.\r\nThis study extends the practical application of ST methodologies into A&F. By presenting this integrated framework, it contributes to the foundation for future research on applying ST to improve the technology adoption decision-making in A&F."

    "This thesis explores the intricate electronic phenomena in Moir\u00e9 systems, particularly focusing on twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD). These systems, with their unique superlattice structures and strong electron correlations, provide fertile ground for investigating novel quantum states. A key focus is on understanding Hofstadter physics and the emergence of composite fermion phases in these materials. In this work, we first develop a continuum model to describe the low-energy electronic structure of twisted TMD bilayers, emphasizing the role of the Moir\u00e9 superlattice in modifying the band structure and introducing non-trivial topological properties. We analyze the resulting Hofstadter spectrum under an external magnetic field, revealing the rich fractal pattern and the impact of valley polarization induced by the magnetic field. Building on this framework, we delve into the concept of composite fermions, particularly in the context of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). We extend Jain\u2019s composite fermion theory and the Chern-Simons field theory to Moir\u00e9 TMD systems, proposing the existence of an anomalous composite fermion liquid state at half-filling. Through a detailed mean-field analysis, we demonstrate that this state, characterized by a strong valley polarization and an effective magnetic field arising from Berry curvature, could be energetically favored under certain conditions. Our findings suggest that Moir\u00e9 TMDs are promising candidates for realizing fractional Chern insulators and other exotic quantum phases, opening up new avenues for experimental exploration and potential applications in quantum technology."

    "Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide variety of domains and is often leveraged for making high-stakes decisions. Parallel to its growing and beneficial presence in other domains, deep learning is gaining a notable reputation for solving challenging problems in geophysics. A key problem - given the escalating energy and geosequestration demands in present times - is marine statics correction. The traditional workflow for correcting marine statics has been based on a model-centric paradigm. This paradigm involves a series of transformations between non-commensurate spaces: first, inversion from seismic data space to velocity model space and second, forward modeling from velocity model space to seismic data space. Statics correction within this paradigm has severe drawbacks, mainly the high compute, time and labor cost, and inaccuracies stemming from errors in velocity model inversion or from unmet assumptions about subsurface structure. Overcoming these drawbacks was thus, the prime motivation for our study - where we chose to leverage deep learning as the core algorithmic tool to understand the limits of the model-centric paradigm and explore the performance horizons of a different, data-centric, paradigm to statics correction. The main feature of the data-centric paradigm is the direct mapping between commensurate data spaces, eliminating the need for intermediary transformations to and from velocity model space. Initial benchmark tests on the model-centric approach revealed the impact of inaccuracies in velocity model inversion as substantial nonzero timeshifts - exceeding 0.01s, and reaching values as large as 0.04s - for most arrivals in seismic data. These arrival time precision levels are unacceptable for good seismic imaging and time-lapse analysis; underscoring the need for an improved approach to marine statics correction. Consequently, we began our investigations into the data-centric paradigm. With the focus of disentangling the effects of varying seawater velocity from coherent subsurface geology in seismic records, we implemented an autoencoder algorithm, named SymAE. Notably, SymAE leverages the permutation symmetry of coherent subsurface information to perform the separation of information from nuisance variations. Once trained, SymAE is able to redatum selected subsurface and water velocity information in its latent space to produce statics-corrected seismic records. Our results show that for training datasets of increasing subsurface complexity, SymAE strongly converges all dynamic timeshifts to zero, aligning perturbed traces to reference traces. Crucially, SymAE delivers the required timeshift precision of 0.01 seconds for all arrivals - an achievement that the model-centric approach falls short of. This notable precision improvement using SymAE highlights how a streamlined data-centric paradigm outperforms the traditional model-centric paradigm of marine statics correction. This finding is pivotal as it is the foundation that lays the groundwork and opens the path towards the real-world deployment of SymAE for statics correction in challenging deepwater environments."

    "Fueled by technological breakthroughs, advancements in our understanding of infectious agents offer unprecedented potential for their early detection, intervention, and ultimately, eradication. This dissertation focuses on combining cutting-edge immunological, diagnostic, and computational approaches to confront infectious diseases more effectively, with a particular emphasis on SARS-CoV-2. The first two chapters delve into the immunological aspects of SARS-CoV-2, exploring the dynamics of antibody responses during primary infection and reinfection. First, we explore the dynamics of antibody responses during primary infection, revealing a \u201cswitch-like\u201d relationship between antibody titer and function. Next, we investigate the humoral immune response following reinfection, identifying specific biomarkers that differentiate between primary infection and reinfection, offering potential tools for monitoring disease spread and understanding immunity. The subsequent chapter shifts focus towards technological innovation in diagnostics, presenting a novel bead-based method for CRISPR diagnostics that leverages a split-luciferase reporter system for enhanced sensitivity and a highly deployable bead-based platform for multiplexed pathogen detection. This work represents a significant advancement in rapid, scalable, and portable diagnostic tools. Finally, the dissertation culminates with a leap into computational biology, introducing \u2019Janus,\u2019 a subquadratic state space model designed to efficiently handle large biological sequences. Janus demonstrates superior performance in genomics and proteomics tasks, outperforming existing models with significantly fewer parameters, thus paving the way for more efficient and accurate modeling of protein behavior and other biological processes. Collectively, these works contribute to the broader field of infectious disease research with new immunological insights paired with advances in technological and computational solutions."

    "This study demonstrates that the rapid urbanization of the Islamic world in its first five centuries can be attributed in part to the development of an independent class of city administrators who ensured that urban life thrived even in the most tumultuous of political times. This dissertation subverts existing historical models of urbanism, which were developed for medieval Europe, by excavating a theorization of the city from the political writings of the philosopher al-Farabi (d. 950), who argues that cities require the administrative wisdom of learned men trained in law. To historically corroborate al-Farabi\u2019s theory, which has been cast as utopian, I identify these learned men in the historical record as the \u02bfulama\u02be. I demonstrate that early Islamic learning was a complex but ordered system\u2014even before its institutionalization\u2014first by articulating its delineations via a praxis of personally conferring and acquiring \u02bfilm (knowledge). This praxis was, I demonstrate, informed by a widely held view that \u02bfilm was metaphysically substantiated. The \u02bfulama\u02be\u2014those marked by \u02bfilm\u2014inherited their legal authority from the Prophet via the transmission of hadith and thus did not rely entirely on the political vesting of the caliph or amir to carry out Islamic law on the level of the city. I demonstrate that the \u02bfulama\u02be, with their independent legal authority, served as city administrators via two primary positions\u2014the qadi (judge) and the mu\u1e25tasib (officer of public order)\u2014and various other positions delegated by these two offices. Just as the system of early Islamic learning was regularized across the Islamic world, so too was the administration of cities by the \u02bfulama\u02be. Through city administration, the \u02bfulama\u02becultivated favorable living conditions in cities. Their relative independence from the state allowed for a continuity in city administration\u2014and thus a continuity in urbanism\u2014that survived the many political upheavals that came to define the Islamic world in the tenth and eleventh centuries."

    "Introns are ubiquitous features of eukaryotic genes, and their precise removal from pre-mRNA transcripts by the spliceosome is an essential step in gene expression. Genomic deletion of an intron from a gene tends to reduce its expression, and addition of an intron tends to increase it. This phenomenon, termed Intron-Mediated Enhancement (IME), has been observed in many organisms, genes, and introns. IME can act at multiple levels to increase transcription rate, processing rate, export efficiency, translational efficiency, and stability of the processed mRNA. These stimulatory effects range across orders of magnitude depending on the context, and also on the identity of the intron, as has been shown in Arabidopsis thaliana. Presently, little is known how intron sequence may determine the mode or magnitude of effect on gene expression output in animals. In this study we report the design and execution of several massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), interrogating the effect of tens of thousands of synthetic and natural intron sequences on gene expression in the human HEK293T and HeLa cell lines. We observe that even with random internal sequence, most of these introns splice well and trigger IME. In the primary tested context, the average intron stimulates an eight-fold increase in both mRNA and protein output over intronless controls, suggesting that the enhancement is largely at the level of mRNA accumulation. We analyze the sequence features associated with highly-enhancing introns and demonstrate that the poly-uridine (polyU) content of an intron is positively correlated with its impact on host gene mRNA and protein level. In a second library of natural intron sequences, we observe that U12-type introns do not stimulate IME, while U2-type introns universally do. Surprisingly, we observe in both MPRAs that the enhancement from random introns is similar to or greater than the enhancement from natural sequences. In sum, we have developed a robust experimental platform for interrogating the sequence-activity relationship of IME, and used it to uncover new insights into this unsung sculptor of eukaryotic gene expression."

    "The demand for the product under investigation exceeds the available manufacturing capacity, with the CNC milling workcell identified as the bottleneck operation. This research, conducted in an active, high-mix, low-volume production environment, focuses on evaluating and implementing improvements to CNC machining parameters to enhance the workcell's capacity. Key areas of investigation include machining speeds and feeds, depth of cut, machine settings, toolpath strategies, stepover percentages, and alternative tooling. The study specifically targeted the initial roughing operation, which uses a feed mill and is the longest milling process. Addressing the challenges of high mix and low volume, the research successfully optimized machining and CNC programming parameters, reducing total machining cycle times by 25% and resulting in a 33% increase in throughput. Additionally, the methodologies and findings from this work have provided a framework for implementing further milling process improvements outside of the roughing operation, demonstrating their applicability to similar production scenarios."

    "Modeling the plasma etch process is highly valuable in the field of semiconductor manufacturing. This intricate process relies on the execution of numerous individual processes, numbering in the hundreds to thousands. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in optimizing these steps presents a revolutionary prospect for the industry. In this thesis, we share our findings for plasma etch recipe optimization using AI and ML. We present a series of plasma etch datasets generated from ViennaPS, as well as a new data augmentation algorithm for generating a uniform spatial and temporal distribution of data points. Our results on this dataset demonstrate improved model generalization using physically-informed neural networks (PINNs) with a level-set based loss. We highlight performance metrics for Soft-Adapt learned physics loss weights, as well as statically chosen weights. Future work includes utilizing the PINN model in a Bayesian framework to facilitate recipe optimization for the desired etch profile."

    "Jump process models based on chemical reaction networks are ubiquitous, especially in systems biology modeling. However, performing inference on the latent variables and parameters of such models is challenging, particularly when the observations of the system state are noisy and incomplete. This thesis presents CatalystFitting, a system for inferring the latent variables and parameters of stochastic reaction network models given observational data. CatalystFitting provides primitives for performing changes of measure on jump processes. Building on top of these primitives, CatalystFitting further provides a library of strategies for guiding a jump process to match an observation set. These strategies exploit the form of the underlying symbolic reaction network to automatically produce guides optimized to the particular reaction network structure of interest to the modeler, accelerating otherwise costly Bayesian inference procedures. We present inference results on a bistable switch system and a repressilator system."

    "Natural language instruction following capabilities are important for robots to follow tasks specified by human commands. Hence, many language conditioned robots have been trained on a wide variety of datasets with tasks annotated by natural language instructions. However, these datasets are often limited in their size and hence the distribution and nature of the instructions given by real world users might be different from that in the datasets. This makes it unclear how these robots will perform in real world environments. Hence, a large scale evaluation with diverse instructions is needed to benchmark the performance of these robots. However, using humans to collect more annotations is prohibitively expensive. We show that recent large language models provide a scalable and inexpensive way to do such an evaluation. Moreover, there is a large performance drop in robots when evaluated on this larger set of instructions. We also show that we can use different prompts to LLMs to control properties such as diversity of the generated instructions."

    "Humans lack specialized receptors for perceiving wetness and so it is a compound sensation based on changes in skin temperature and contact pressure that are sensed by thermoreceptors and mechanoreceptors in the skin. In addition to perceiving the wetness of damp fabrics in contact with the skin or the presence of sweat on the skin, humans can perceive wetness in the absence of any moisture, a phenomenon known as illusory wetness. The illusion has been shown to arise when the skin is in contact with a surface and is cooled.   This thesis is focused on understanding the variables that contribute to illusory wetness by first determining the difference threshold for perceiving the rate of skin cooling and relating this to perceived wetness. The results from the first two experiments showed that the difference threshold averaged 0.9 \u00b0C/s -1.06 \u00b0C/s at a reference value of 0. 5 \u00b0C/s. For perceiving wetness, the threshold averaged 1.08 \u00b0C/s - 1.41 \u00b0C/s. The latter finding indicates that the rate the skin cools exceeds some threshold value before it is perceived as being wet. A third experiment explored the role of temperature and surface material in the perception of illusory wetness. The results showed that temperature was the more critical valuable, with ratings of perceived wetness increasing as the temperature decreased further below the baseline skin temperature. These experiments have demonstrated the effect that rates of cooling have on perceiving illusory wetness and have contributed to a better understanding of the role of surface material and temperature on perceiving wetness during static contact. These findings are relevant to simulating wetness in prosthetic devices and virtual reality environments."

    "This dissertation examines the labor and life of disabled workers in China\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) data annotation programs. The study draws on 14 months of ethnographic fieldwork, conducted over three years, with disabled activists, disabled workers, employment advocates, tech company staff, and government officials. This is supplemented by five years of my professional experience in disability nonprofits. My primary field site was a disabled people-led NGO founded in 2006, which I refer to as ENABLE. In recent years, ENABLE has developed numerous projects with tech companies to hire people with visual and physical impairments as data annotators for AI systems and to design assistive technologies for the community.\r\n\r\nIn ENABLE\u2019s case, what appears to be a familiar story of capitalist exploitation of disabled people turns out to be, instead, a story about the struggles of disabled Chinese people over different ways of being, living, and relating. I use the term \u201cautonomy work\u201d to describe disabled people\u2019s labor to make \u201cautonomous\u201d machines (zidonghua) (Chapter 1), build an \u201cautonomous\u201d life (zizhu shenghuo) through work (Chapters 2 & 3), and design tools for \u201cindependent\u201d navigation (duli chuxing) (Chapter 4).\r\n\r\nI argue that disabled activists seek to construct greater autonomy for their community by reconfiguring social relations in and around technology. I call this mechanism \u201crerouting.\u201d Instead of a complete departure from asymmetrical power relations, my interlocutors \u201creroute\u201d the pathways between different human and non-human nodes without changing the nodes per se. They do so within the sociotechnical systems they build, the technological institutions they navigate, the kinship structures they seek to remake through tech work, and the physical terrain they navigate with assistive devices, all in pursuit of multiple forms of autonomy. \u201cRerouting\u201d contributes to the rich scholarship on the intersection of disability and technoscience by highlighting the effects of disabled people\u2019s unorthodox knowledge and practices that bend the world towards disabled bodies and minds. Furthermore, it specifies a key mechanism through which these effects are realized. Disabled people hack lives, build access, and improvise affordances by reorganizing the pathways between objects, bodies, and environments that were originally designed with other intentions.\r\n\r\nWith deep knowledge and lived experience of the social issues they advocate for, disabled activists in China approach technology as a puzzle piece, not a magic bullet. They make technology useful for their lives, work, and activism by returning the technical to the social. Rather than displacing the slow work of social movements with neoliberal techno-solutionism, I show that this community-driven technological engagement is part of a larger effort to sustain that very slow work within a shifting political environment."

    "Biomolecular condensates are phase-separated assemblies in living cells that form through cooperative interactions between their constituents such as proteins and RNAs. They are emerging as important organizers of biochemistry in cells and are dysregulated in disease. Understanding the physical principles that shape the form and function of these condensates is a fundamental scientific challenge, which if addressed can provide novel therapeutic avenues to improve human health. The equilibrium principles behind condensate formation are well understood. Several studies have investigated the impact of multivalency, protein sequence, protein-RNA interactions, and the role of DNA in modulating biomolecular interactions that drive phase separation. However, the living cell is inherently out of equilibrium with non-equilibrium reactions that constantly burn ATP and turn over biomolecules. My thesis investigates how the interplay between biomolecular interactions and non-equilibrium reactions that turn over biomolecules affect the structure and function of biomolecular condensates. Phase-field modeling is used for these investigations, as this approach has been historically successful in answering similar questions in other fields such as material science. Prior work shows that proteins present in biomolecular condensates associated with RNA transcription undergo complex coacervation with the RNA product. The first project in this thesis investigates the interplay between complex coacervation and spatially heterogeneous RNA synthesis on condensate morphology and dynamics using a phase-field model. This simple model exhibits a rich variety of dynamical behaviors and steady states. It also provides a unifying framework to explain diverse experimental observations related to condensate morphology and dynamics such as vacuole formation, aspherical shapes, directed motion, and splitting-fusion behaviors. The second project investigates how transcription of messenger RNA (mRNA) by transcriptional condensates is modulated by other RNAs in the vicinity, such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Our model reveals that lncRNA transcription in the vicinity can regulate mRNA transcription by altering the protein concentration and lifetime of transcriptional condensates, 3 promoting mRNA transcription from genes expressed at a low level and inhibiting transcription from highly expressed genes. This model provides a unifying framework to reconcile conflicting observations in the literature about transcriptional regulation by lncRNAs. The final project focuses on the fibrillar center of the nucleolus, an important condensate that is involved in ribosome biogenesis. Using a phase-field model that explicitly accounts for rRNA-protein interactions in the nucleolus and the non-equilibrium reaction of rRNA transcription, we show that the coarsening of fibrillar centers is arrested leading to a preferred size. Altering this size affects rRNA export and processing from the fibrillar centers. These predictions are validated by experiments. Using a combination of experiments and theory, we uncover the non-equilibrium mechanism that controls size control of fibrillar centers and the functional consequences of this size control on rRNA processing."

    "Sheet metal manufacturers continuously seek methods to enhance automation and reduce costs. This thesis explores process substitution and design standardization through a parameter-driven cost model and case studies applying Design for Manufacturability & Assembly (DFMA) principles. Specifically, it evaluates substituting conventional sheet metal components with extruded steel profiles and replacing manual press brake operations with automated tube laser cutting. The findings show that tube laser adoption across a broad range of channels can reduce costs by 49% to 79%, with a payback period of under two years, even in scenarios with fluctuating raw material prices. The study proposes strategies for maximizing tube laser utilization through product mix analysis, redesign for compatibility, and designing with tube laser as the primary method. A developed automation tool using clustering aids profile identification, though the study highlights the need for improved data management around C-channel dimensions to enhance process standardization. The investigation confirms that extruded steel can be a cost-effective alternative to large-scale channel products, providing solutions for industry transition through direct replacement, compatibility-focused redesign, or design guidelines optimized for extruded steel."

    "Despite advancements in causal inference and prescriptive AI, its adoption in enterprise settings remains hindered primarily due to its complexity and lack of interpretability. This work at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab focuses on extending upon the proof-of-concept agent, PrecAIse, by designing a domain-adaptable conversational agent equipped with a suite of causal and prescriptive tools. The objective is to make advanced, novel causal inference and prescriptive tools widely accessible through natural language interactions. The presented Natural Language User Interface (NLUI) enables users with limited expertise in machine learning and data science to harness prescriptive analytics in their decision-making processes without requiring intensive compute. We present an agent capable of function calling, maintaining faithful, interactive, and dynamic conversations, and supporting new domains."

    "An important benefit of modern school choice programs may be increased retention of students in large urban districts. Enrollment effects of choice frameworks are especially important today, as traditional public school enrollment as a share of total enrollment has fallen sharply since the pandemic. This paper asks whether and how the design of centralized assignment schemes, such as those used in numerous large urban districts, affects enrollment. Specifically, I focus on the question of how unified enrollment programs impact enrollment choice between traditional public schools, charter schools, and private schools. Using syn- thetic controls and event study models, this analysis suggests that the adoption of unified enrollment systems boosts charter enrollment as well as overall public school enrollment. At the same time, effect sizes vary across individual districts, and school choice policy should be mindful of the particular circumstances of each district."

    "Development of domain-specific hardware accelerators has been an important focus for high performance computing research in recent years, enabling significant gains in a variety of practical applications. Of particular interest is accelerator design for applications involving sparse data. Such accelerators inherently tend towards a diverse array of architecture designs, and often rely on custom simulators for evaluation. In addition to raw performance, energy consumption and chip area are both important considerations for evaluating accelerators. Accelergy is a tool that provides a good general framework for fine-grained energy and area estimation. However, output from simulation tools may not be compatible with Accelergy\u2019s expected input format, which is the case for the custom simulator Accelsim. To address this gap, this work presents a streamlined plugin for processing Accelsim simulator output into Accelergy input, for the purpose of generating accurate and explainable energy consumption and area models for accelerator architectures. We demonstrate the plugin\u2019s flexibility by performing energy and area estimates for two state-of-the-art hardware accelerators, ISOSceles and Trapezoid. Overall, this plugin is easy-to-use, self-contained, and supports a wide variety of configurable functionalities, making it an excellent general tool for running Accelergy on Accelsim output."

    "2D materials, or layers of one-atom thick crystalline solids, offer a flexible solution for a variety of applications that require certain characteristics. As a result of modifications in physical and chemical design involving 2D materials such as stacking, twisting and ion intercalation, properties such as electrical conductivity, spin diffusion length, thermal conductivity, and mechanical strength observe more degrees of freedom than in their bulk material counterpart. Currently, small optical systems comprise of passive devices that are rigid in their light pathing design and require modulators to control light post-fabrication for use. These systems are confined by the material used to fabricate the device and their associated effective indices, which are determined pre-fabrication by the ultimate desired optical effect. However, 2D materials can exhibit tunable band structures that yield the optimal optical response, even post-fabrication. This thesis will discuss the properties of mechanically and chemically manipulated niobium oxydichloride (NbOCl\u2082) and niobium oxydiiodide (NbOI\u2082) ultrathin structures that have the potential to integrate into flexible optical systems."

    "microRNAs (miRNAs) are short, ~22-nucleotide noncoding RNAs that base-pair to messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to direct their post-transcriptional repression through their associated Argonaute (AGO) proteins. Animal genomes encode hundreds of miRNAs that, together, regulate a majority of mRNAs and tune spatiotemporal gene expression programs. The production and degradation of many miRNAs occurs in a regulated manner, but molecular pathways of miRNA degradation are relatively poorly understood.\r\nSome rapidly degraded miRNAs owe their instability to a mechanism termed target-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD), whereby unusual miRNA binding sites with extensive complementarity to the miRNA promote a conformational shift in AGO, leading to the recruitment of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing the substrate receptor ZSWIM8. The subsequent polyubiquitination and proteolysis of AGO liberates the miRNA, rendering it vulnerable to nucleases. TDMD underlies the instability of many miRNAs in diverse cell lines and animals.\r\nIn this work, I probe the biological scope of TDMD as a regulatory mechanism in the nematode Caenorhabiditis elegans, which tolerates homozygous loss of the ZSWIM8 ortholog, EBAX-1, and expresses some miRNAs that are subject to rapid, developmentally regulated decay. I have confidently identified at least 22 miRNAs destabilized by EBAX-1 across the worm life cycle. These included the embryonic miR-35\u201342 family as well as certain stress-responsive miRNAs that together constitute some of the shortest-lived miRNAs in this organism. In mutants of ebax-1, the accumulated miR-35\u201342 excessively repressed predicted target mRNAs and underwent 3\u2032 trimming as they aged, though no consistent signature of 3\u2032 trimming or tailing emerged for EBAX-1-sensitive miRNAs.\r\nA recent study reports that the destabilization of miR-35 at the embryo-to-L1 transition does not depend on that miRNA\u2019s 3\u2032 region, unlike canonical mammalian TDMD. To test the generality of this result for other EBAX-1 sensitive miRNAs, I assayed the behavior of seed- or 3\u2032-based miR-43 variants in the presence and absence of EBAX-1. Intriguingly, the miR-43 3\u2032 variants showed substantially reduced propensity to be regulated by EBAX-1. The requirement for 3\u2032 pairing therefore varies between EBAX-1 sensitive miRNAs, raising questions about the molecular features of TDMD trigger RNAs that recruit EBAX-1 when extensive pairing is not crucial."

    "Formalizations of instruction-set semantics help establish formal proofs of correctness of both hardware designed to implement these instruction sets and the software implemented against this specification. One such prior work1 formalizes a specification of a subset of the RISC-V instruction-set architecture using a general-purpose language, Haskell, using its monad and typeclass support to abstract over effects. Another member of the same family is the RISC-V V extension, which specifies instructions for operating on multiple data elements in a single instruction, which is useful for domains with high levels of data parallelism, such as graphics rendering and machine learning. In this work I examine the question of whether the same prior work can be extended to formalize the semantics of the vector extension. I answer this question with a tentative \u201cyes\u201d, backed by a partial specification in Haskell of a small but nontrivial subset of this vector extension, a translation of the same specification into Coq using hs-to-coq\u00b2, and work towards demonstrating the utility of this specification."

    "Tumor cell plasticity in cancer is a key driver in tumor progression, heterogeneity, metastasis, and treatment resistance. Tumor cells change states from the conventionally easier to treat epithelial state to the more resistant mesenchymal state. Understanding the transition dynamics of these states and the extrinsic factors influencing them is crucial for improving therapeutic strategies and patient outcomes. Utilizing spatial transcriptomics extrinsic driving factors of plasticity can be probed. We introduce PlastiNet, which uses a graphical attention-based network to create a spatial aware embedding. The utility of our approach is validated in model systems, specifically in the brain and colon, where it successfully identifies biologically relevant neighborhoods and maps differentiation pathways. When applied to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), distinct, conserved neighborhoods within the tissue, including diverse immune and cancer clusters. By estimating a differentiation path from epithelial to mesenchymal-like cells, we can identify intermediate states despite a limited set of tumor marker genes. This cellular differentiation path shows enrichment and depletion of certain cell types within local neighborhoods aligning with known correlations, and by leveraging inferred ligand-receptor interactions, we can pinpoint potential drivers of plasticity to test in vitro. PlastiNet effectively generates hypotheses directly from patient-derived spatial transcriptomics samples, offering insights into the cellular mechanisms driving tumor plasticity."

    "Laboratory experiments investigated the dynamics controlling the cross-shelf exchange in a prograde sloping canyon induced by dense shelf water descending into the canyon. This thesis is motivated by the dispersal of dense water generated by polynyas on the Arctic and Antarctic continental shelves. Laboratory results corroborate prior numerical results suggesting that canyons are hotspots of cross-shelf exchange. When the dense water descends a canyon, it induces an onshore return flow of offshore water into the canyon. This return flow is initially driven by the dense water eddies descending the canyon and acting like a bucket brigade. At later times, another mechanism may also be at play where large dense cyclonic (anticlockwise) eddies on the northern continental shelf may pull more dense water out of the canyon producing a region of low pressure, near the canyon head, which induces an increase in ambient flow into the canyon. The Burger number (Rossby radius of deformation/canyon width) and the dense water source location with respect to the canyon head affect the offshore ambient water velocity up the canyon. Additionally, as the offshore water reaches the canyon head, the offshore water volume flux becomes larger than the dense water volume flux, possibly due to the low pressure region described above. Understanding these dynamics in the Antarctica region is of global significance for two main reasons: 1. The offshore flowing dense water forms Antarctic Bottom Water and thus affects the global meridional circulation; 2. The onshore heat transport induced by the return flow drives glacial ice melt and therefore contributes to sea level rise."

    "This thesis develops string field theory whose elementary interactions are parameterized using hyperbolic geometry. We introduce a systematic procedure to characterize its off-shell data: the local coordinates around punctures on Riemann surfaces as a function of complex structure and the vertex regions in the relevant moduli spaces over which the moduli integration is performed. This procedure exploits the relation between hyperbolic geometry and the semi-classical Liouville theory. We demonstrate that the (generalized) hyperbolic three-string vertex is exactly solvable, while the higher-order vertices can be obtained via the conformal bootstrap of Liouville theory in terms of classical conformal blocks and the DOZZ formula. The four-string and tadpole vertices are constructed explicitly using the known expressions of the associated blocks. Our method suggests the existence of a hidden cubic structure within hyperbolic string field theory.\r\n\r\nWe also take the WKB-like limit of our construction and demonstrate that it can be used to characterize Strebel quadratic differentials on Riemann surfaces. These differentials encode the geometry of polyhedral vertices of classical closed string field theory. The implication is that they can be embedded into the hyperbolic paradigm. The validity of our results in this regime is further confirmed by developing a topology-independent machine learning algorithm characterizing Strebel differentials. Such algorithm provides an alternative, numerically scalable approach for computing closed string field theory interactions. Finally, our work investigates the open-closed string field theory in the presence of large number of D-branes. We establish its consistency by solving the relevant geometric version of the Batalin-Vilkovisky master equation using hyperbolic geometry and investigate its limits."

    "Affinity networks, also known as Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), are increasingly essential in today\u2019s corporate world as they play a crucial role in fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion within organizations. These groups provide a platform for employees from underrepresented or marginalized communities to connect, share experiences, and find\r\nsupport. ERGs geared towards Hispanic employees are often advertised as not only a means to connect with others and provide a sense of belonging but are also often promoted as avenues towards successful professional development and growth for underrepresented employees. This research explores the perspectives of a group of experienced engineers from various technical backgrounds and industries to understand if there is a correlation between generational status for Hispanic Americans and their overall perceived benefits from participating in ERGs. The study provides a detailed literature review of relevant existing research on this subject, followed by semi-structured interviews of ten participants, and a thematic analysis approach used to analyze the data into the following five themes: diversity considerations for school and job selections, employee perspective on ERGs, sense of belonging and generational differences, the meaning of inclusiveness, and continued participation. Finally, a research conclusion and a series of recommendations are provided."

    "The advancement of neural networks in the last several years has yielded some astonishing results. However, the applicability to system identification and modelling dynamical systems still has a great amount of room for exploration. This thesis reviews different neural network architectures and their application to complex non-linear dynamic system identification. In particular, it uses the intricate process of coffee roasting as a case study to explore and demonstrate these techniques. Coffee roasting is a complex process that requires precise control to achieve the desired coffee quality. The ability to develop models that represent a system, i.e. system identification, is of great value to industry. Coffee roasting poses several challenges for system identification from complex chemical reactions occurring inside the bean, to temperature trajectories being dependent on several states that cannot be explicitly measured, such as moisture content, or reaction rate, making it an ideal candidate for exploring the application and limitations of neural networks. The primary contributions of this study are a proposed \"grey-box\" model that augments previously established physics based models, as well as illustrating the limits of LSTM, Deep NARX models using \"one-step\" forward prediction techniques. Although the study focuses explicitly on coffee roasting, the conclusions drawn are applicable to other similarly complex industrial and manufacturing processes."

    "Materials development is the foundation for innovation in many industries and fields, however, this process is traditionally slow and resource-intensive. Most often, new materials are developed and characterized on the time scale of years which can limit the pace of scientific and industry innovation. I address the material synthesis and characterization bottleneck by presenting a framework that I believe is suitable for smaller labs: Self-built, low-cost automation. The design philosophy is to de-risk the lab automation process by keeping costs low, failing fast, and leveraging common resources in electronic systems and additive manufacturing. I present an improved version of a low-cost but high-throughput inkjet material printer developed by Siemenn et al. and adapted to operation in the glovebox, hood, and benchtop environments. The tool is capable of depositing gradients of droplets with unique compositions at a rate of up to 1000 materials per minute, is self-built, and costs around $500. I also present a computer-vision-enabled high-throughput material characterization algorithm for stability quantification through color degradation. The synthesis and characterization methods are validated on a methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite material system. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and hyperspectral imaging measurements show equivalence between high-throughput synthesis and more traditional spin-coating methods. Results obtained through the high-throughput stability characterization method are aligned with stability trends reported in the literature and have an accuracy of 96.9% when compared to ground-truth degradation as measured by a domain expert."

    "Accommodating urban population growth while reducing emissions from the built environment poses an unprecedented challenge to the architectural discipline. To enable more sustainable construction, the dissertation proposes a new computational design framework to investigate how building performance from an environmental and user perspective relates to spatial design. The dissertation surveys existing computational methodologies for design automation and identifies new opportunities and value propositions for architectural computing in design guidance, feedback, and optimization. Exploring methods that can be used to generate and optimize structural systems of buildings and interior layouts, a specific focus lies in the design of residential buildings. By applying generative design methods to building analytics, new ways for estimating the embodied carbon of a building and the environmental impact of system-level design choices can be explored.\r\nFirst, the research demonstrates how generative geometric algorithms can be coupled with structural simulations to accurately predict the structural material quantity and, through that, the embodied carbon of a building in early stages of design. Second, a new method for representing, analyzing, and generating spatial layouts \u2013 the hypergraph \u2013 is proposed, that captures the characteristics of any given floor plan. Unveiling new architectural opportunities through automatic geometry creation, the hypergraph shows potential to improve the quality of residential spaces in terms of environmental performance and access to daylight. Enabling new design tools for architects, it offers creative applications and new collaborative workflows for incorporating new spatial metrics in the design process. Allowing for new quantitative insights in building performance, the research demonstrates that spatial efficiency can outperform envelope upgrades in terms of carbon emission savings."

    "The United States Coast Guard faces significant challenges transitioning new ships from shipbuilding to operations. Historically the low volume and irregular pace of major ship deliveries, combined with diverse homeporting factors, have resulted in anomalous post-delivery requirements. Today, a growing fleet, personnel shortages, and sweeping technological advancements are amplifying the complexity of post-delivery activities. At the same time, the Coast Guard is engaged in its largest shipbuilding effort since World War II, with seven acquisition programs scheduled to deliver 134 new ships over the next 15 years. In light of these factors the current approach, which places significant strain on crews, escalates costs, and delays operational use of the Coast Guard\u2019s newest assets, warrants thorough examination. This thesis examines the issue through case study analyses using the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) Program. The Coast Guard\u2019s challenges are driven by three primary factors: the inherent uncertainty in ship construction, sociotechnical system dynamics associated with organizational management of pre-commissioning crews, and the ongoing evolution of technology. To address these challenges, this analysis employs an integrated approach, synthesizing principles and techniques from Architecting Innovative Enterprise Strategy (ARIES), Flexible Engineering Design (FED), and System Design and Management (SDM). This systems thinking approach aims to develop opportunities to reduce costs, improve schedules, and optimize workforce outcomes. The analysis recommends a three-phased strategy that could yield cost savings on the order of $400 million over the OPC Program\u2019s lifespan, significantly mitigate risks associated with unforeseen shipbuilding developments, and enhance organizational outcomes regarding workforce, operational availability, and life cycle sustainment. The staffing of pre-commissioning crews is pinpointed as a pivotal discretionary event that triggers an exponential increase in system complexity and a surge in scope by introducing interdependent yet organizationally disparate requirements. Consequently, major personnel activities are decoupled from highly variable ship construction milestones. This paves the way for a paradigm shift from fixed to flexible approaches, replacing fragmented, ad hoc approaches with a flexible system architecture capable of continuous enterprise learning and improvement. Dynamic post-delivery activities are reimagined as a continuous business line, to professionalize the transition of new ships from shipbuilding to operations."

    "Is it possible for major political events, such as the U.S. Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, to influence political attitudes in other countries? Such events may act as framing devices that influence individuals to think somewhat differently about democracy and populism, primarily by reminding them of domestic shortcomings. Some previous literature has found international attitude effects from major events like terrorism or environmental disasters. In this study, I take advantage of the fact that the insurrection took place in the middle of a set of surveys administered to bureaucrats in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. The events of Jan. 6 thus act as a type of exogenous shock, thus allowing for an interrupted time series analysis. I find that satisfaction with democracy generally declined across all three countries but only in Chile did support for democracy and elections fall and populist attitudes rise."

However, fine-tuning on small datasets can lead to overfitting and a lack of generalization. Generalization is crucial when deploying models that perform a sensitive tasks in a real world environment, as it dictates how well it performs on unseen data. Conversely, overfitting is highly likely to occur when training on small datasets. This thesis proposes and evaluates a new method for fine-tuning language models by adaptively choosing specific learning rates for each transformer layer that provide higher performance on in-domain low-volume datasets. Additionally, we explore which layers inside the models usually hold more contextual information from pre-training that might be valuable to keep \u2018frozen\u2019 when fine-tuning on small datasets. This analysis provides insights into fine-tuning approaches during initial experiments when data is limited. Our results demonstrate limited performance gains on certain models while achieving more significant gains on others when fine-tuning using our proposed method. Additionally, our work also provides valuable insight into per-layer importance of language models by showing that certain layers have a stronger direct correlation with the overall model accuracy."

    "The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has enabled health care professionals to non-invasively visualize subjects' soft tissue for medical diagnosis. Since it's conception, artifacts due to patients' movement have shown themselves to be an issue and an assortment of tools and methods have been developed to help mitigate the effect of motion on MRI but such mitigation methods are generally only applicable on a case by case basis depending on the specific type of motion. As such, additional research is required to develop novel methods and a standardized method of testing, validating, and ultimately comparing mitigation strategies.\r\n\r\nThis work provides a design to develop a motion stage as well as build instructions for the Martinos head phantom which moves in four degrees of freedom (linear translation in the plane parallel to the floor, a head shaking \"no\" motion, and a head nodding \"yes\" motion) independently of one another to limited success. Only the translation in direction (into and out of the bore hole, along the z-axis) worked as expected, while the translation perpendicular to it (x-axis) did not. The total range of motion that head phantom was capable of turning in the head shaking/\"no\" motion was approximately 19 degrees, though the torque required is on the higher end (on the order of 0.06 N*m) and the position of the rotational actuator needs some reexamination. The head nodding/\"yes\" mechanism is more promising, allowing for a tilt downwards of 1 degrees and upwards of 2 degrees, but requires actuators capable of exerting 6N of force or more."

    "Malaria is responsible for half a million deaths each year in some of the poorest communities around the world. Furthermore, the evolution of drug resistance among malaria parasites threatens to continue this trend. However, our understanding of malaria parasite biology is held back by a lack of tools with which to study the function of their genes. In light of this, we have created systems that control gene expression in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum using bacterial repressor proteins. These are the first tools to reliably control malaria parasite transcription and offer the most robust method of conditional gene expression in Plasmodium parasites to date. We develop automated DNA design software to apply this technology to study essential parasite genes for functional genomics and confirm compound-protein interactions for drug discovery. We hope these tools advance efforts to engineer and control malaria parasites in the future."

    "This thesis presents a comprehensive framework for calculating Zakat on modern financial assets specifically tailored for American Muslims. As one of the five pillars of Islam, Zakat is an obligatory form of charity for those who meet specific wealth criteria. However, applying traditional Zakat principles to contemporary financial instruments poses significant challenges, particularly within the context of the U.S. financial system.\r\n\r\nThe research addresses these complexities by developing methodologies that consider diverse financial instruments, valuation challenges, tax implications, accessibility issues, and Shariah compliance. The framework covers a wide range of assets, including cash and bank accounts, stocks, mutual funds, bonds, cryptocurrencies, retirement accounts (401(k)s, Traditional and Roth IRAs), Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), employee stock options, precious metals and jewelry, and real estate investments.\r\n\r\nBridging classical Islamic jurisprudence with modern financial realities, this thesis provides detailed calculation methodologies for each asset class, incorporating U.S.-specific considerations such as tax-deferred accounts and capital gains implications. The framework is designed to be adaptable to evolving financial markets and balances various scholarly opinions on contentious issues. To enhance accessibility, both comprehensive and simplified calculation methods are offered, catering to users with different levels of financial literacy.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this thesis makes a significant contribution to Islamic finance by offering a structured, principle-based approach to Zakat calculation that is both Shariah-compliant and applicable in the modern American financial context. It provides a valuable resource for American Muslims striving to fulfill their religious obligations amidst the complexities of the U.S. financial system and lays the groundwork for future research in Islamic finance in Western contexts."

    "Sheet metal roll forming is a continuous bending process where metal strips pass through a series of rolls to achieve a specific cross-sectional profile. This technique is crucial in the automotive industry for producing high-strength, lightweight components with precision, consistency, and cost-effectiveness. This project aims to optimize Novelis\u2019s aluminum roll forming process by employing Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) tools, including UBECO Profil, AutoCAD, and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software such as LS-DYNA. Initial simulations of a square tube profile identified key stations and led to performance enhancements through targeted adjustments. Stress and strain analyses demonstrated how operational factors, such as roll settings, influence section shapes and angles, facilitating the fine-tuning of roll forming station parameters. Using a Design of Experiments (DOE) framework, the study pinpointed critical factors to improve simulation accuracy and optimize roll forming settings. The results indicated that optimized stand height settings significantly improved the accuracy of the desired angles. These insights can be integrated within Novelis\u2019 production line to boost production efficiency and roll performance. This research not only supports current operations, but also provides a foundation for future advancements in roll forming technology."

    "Nonlinearities from complicated robot systems and harsh contact dynamics have long impeded the effectiveness of optimal control strategies for legged robots. In this work, we present a linearized simple walking model using Koopman Operator Theory, and its usage in Linear Model Predictive Control (L-MPC). Various walking and contact models were evaluated, but ultimately the rimless wheel was selected due to its inherent stability and low dimensionality, and a nonlinear viscoelastic model was used to accurately capture floor contact and impact dynamics. Koopman models were developed using both Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) and neural network-generated observables for the passive rimless wheel. A novel actuation method with linear actuators, combined with the Control Coherent Koopman methodology, resulted in accurate linear models that effectively enabled L-MPC to control the wheel on flat ground. This model outperformed those created using the more traditional Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control method. This work demonstrates the power of Koopman linearization to produce a unified set of linear dynamical equations that encompass various contact and non-contact configurations and demonstrates the effectiveness of the Control Coherent Koopman methodology in generating an accurate input matrix across these different contact modes."

    "Natural gas power generation retrofitted with carbon capture technology is poised to play a crucial role in ensuring energy reliability amidst the transition to variable renewable energy resources. While natural gas generation is used primarily for baseload power, it is expected to transition towards an intermittent power generator, serving as a load-following resource during periods of low renewable energy availability. It will be critical to understand how start-up, shutdown, and load-following behavior may impact system performance and influence future grid design. \r\n\r\nThis thesis performs a comprehensive literature review to establish context on various techniques of carbon capture technology. Post-combustion carbon capture, specifically absorption-based technology, remains the preferred candidate for retrofitting natural gas plants due to its technical maturity, scalability, relatively high capture efficiencies, and ease of retrofitting. The literature highlights that absorption-based carbon capture units exhibit degraded performance during non-steady-state operating conditions. Specifically, cold start-ups result in lower capture efficiencies and higher heat rates, although hot start-ups incur significantly less performance reduction. \r\n\r\nThe literature review findings are integrated into GenX, a grid optimization tool, to evaluate natural gas combined cycle power plants equipped with carbon capture technology. The modified optimization models are run using the ISO New England grid system, and results suggest that incorporating advanced start-up penalties for natural gas plants reduces operational flexibility in an emissions-constrained environment. As capture efficiencies decrease and heat rates increase during start-ups, utilizing natural gas plants becomes more expensive due to the additional emissions and reduced thermal efficiency. Comparing models with different levels of performance degradation during start-up suggests that installing less gas capacity could be optimal, with those units operating at higher capacity factors to mitigate start-up penalties. Under modest emissions constraints, natural gas units may be operated continuously even during periods of renewable energy surplus. Harsher start-up penalties applied to natural gas plants likely increase the incremental value of alternative energy technologies, although natural gas retains a critical role in the energy mix."

    "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful, safe imaging technique based on using magnetism to provide contrast between soft tissues. Portable, low-field MRI is a growing area that has already demonstrated value in both educational and clinical domains. Low-field MRI systems need to acquire data with sample rates in the tens of megahertz, which can make the data acquisition system the bulk of the overall cost of low-cost systems. This work presents the Streamoscope: an open-source data acquisition system designed for low-field MRI that streams two 14-bit resolution channels at 60 megasamples per second over USB-3 into Python. It is approximately $300 in parts, about a quarter of the price of the cheapest data acquisition system on the market that would work in our case study. The Streamoscope can stream full-sample-rate raw MRI data into a computer to be processed in Python, enabling real time imaging. The system has been validated by generating 2D images of a phantom on a system with an 8 MHz Larmor frequency."

    "This paper examines the retrofitting and redevelopment of suburban office parks, and in particular, the planning, design, and policy issues and challenges associated with this redevelopment. Recent literature indicates a shift of suburban business development in favor of increasingly competitive central cities, a dilemma for planners charged with revitalizing aging suburban business parks. To understand the nature and causality of suburban office park retrofitting and redevelopment, we conducted 13 qualitative, semi-structured interviews with planners, developers, and officials in the inner Boston metropolitan region. Interviews indicated increasing obsolescence, with widespread redevelopment as a coping strategy. Strategies included densification, mixed uses, enhanced public spaces, and attempts to enhance transit. We examine two case studies: Northwest Park in Burlington, MA, and Needham Crossing, in Needham, MA: both are former office parks redeveloped as mixed-use developments. Our research clarifies the nature and types of physical redevelopment, as well as the specific motivations behind redevelopment as a planning strategy for enhancing the viability of aging suburban office developments."

    "In recent years, the advancement in cellulosic nanofoams has been considerable. Yet, their customization potential for diverse application requirements has been constrained by reproducibility challenges. Our research, therefore, focused on two primary objectives: enhancing the thermal regulation capabilities and mechanical properties of cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) nanofoams, and developing a reproducible methodology for printing customized three-dimensional (3D) structures using direct-ink-write (DIW) technology and molding.\r\n\r\nWe developed composite nanofoams using TEMPO-modified cellulose nanofiber (TCNF). The resultant composite nanofoams showcased remarkable properties such as ultra-low thermal conductivity, low density, outstanding flexibility, and infrared shielding capabilities.\r\n\r\nIn a bid to create robust and environmentally friendly nanofoams, we employed a crosslinking process with CaCl2. The crosslinked nanofoams were extraordinarily lightweight yet boasted superior mechanical properties, significantly amplified by the crosslinker. Remarkably, these freeze-dried T-CNF/CaCl2 nanofoams maintained their form and demonstrated admirable flexibility, even when subjected to weight exceeding thousands of times their own. Furthermore, transient characterization confirmed their excellent thermal insulation capabilities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, our research has pioneered the fabrication of sustainable, high-stability cellulose nanofoams. We have significantly enhanced the thermal management capabilities and mechanical performance of these nanofoams, marking a remarkable advancement in the field. The demonstrated sustainability, biocompatibility, ultra-light weight, high porosity, and deformability of the resultant nanofoams suggest considerable potential for diverse applications, including thermal insulation, shock and vibration damping, as well as tissue engineering."

    "Membrane-based separation holds significant promise for reducing the high energy consumption associated with traditional thermal-based separation processes in the chemical industry. Recent advancements in microporous materials, such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), have demonstrated performance improvements over conventional polymers. Mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) have emerged as a potent strategy, combining the processability of polymers with the superior separation properties of MOFs to create high-performance membranes. Additionally, the integration of MOFs into polymers can mitigate stability issues such as plasticization, swelling, and physical aging. This thesis investigates MMMs based on PIM-1 and its derivatives, along with UiO MOFs, for gas and organic solvent-based separations. The studies focus on enhancing polymer\u2013MOF interfacial compatibility, understanding penetrant transport, and addressing key challenges in MMM design and fabrication. A longstanding challenge with MMMs fabrication is poor polymer\u2013MOF compatibility, leading to particle agglomeration and non-selective interfacial voids. To address this, the strategy of decorating polymers and MOFs with compatible functional groups was explored. By studying UiO-66-NH2 MOF and carboxylic acid-functionalized PIM-1 (PIM-COOH), it was demonstrated that MMMs with compatible functional groups exhibit enhanced polymer\u2013MOF interaction and plasticization resistance. To further understand transport within these MMMs, self-diffusivities of gases were measured using pulsed-field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance and compared to macroscopic diffusivities obtained from permeation and sorption analysis. The PIM\u2013MOF material platform was also extended to solvent-based separations.To understand solvent transport through microporous polymers, intrinsic properties of swollen polymers were obtained both experimentally and computationally, and these properties were correlated with solvent transport metrics. Finally, MMMs composed of PIM-COOH and UiO MOFs with systematically increasing pore apertures were evaluated for their solvent nanofiltration performance. Key challenges such as MOF instability and non-ideal polymer\u2013MOF interfaces were identified. In summary, this thesis delves into the structure-property relationships of microporous materials for gas and solvent-based separations, offering insights that can guide the future design of advanced composite membranes for challenging separations."

    "Sheet metal roll forming is a continuous bending process where metal strips are fed through a sequence of rolls to achieve a specific cross-sectional profile. This method is vital in the automotive industry for producing high-strength, lightweight components with precision, consistency, and cost-efficiency. This project focuses on optimizing Novelis\u2019s aluminum roll forming process using Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) techniques, including UBECO Profil, AutoCAD, and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) tools such as Ansys and LS-Dyna. Initial simulations on a square tube profile were key in identifying critical stations, leading to performance improvements through targeted adjustments. Stress and strain analyses revealed how operational factors, such as roll adjustments, affect the section shapes and angles, facilitating the refinement of roll forming station settings. With a Design of Experiment (DOE) framework, the study identified key variables to enhance simulation output accuracy and optimize roll forming settings. The team successfully built a digital twin of the new roll forming line, which accurately predicted the final product's geometry and provided precise recommendations for machine settings to achieve the desired shape. Novelis can apply these insights to enhance their software, thereby potentially increasing production efficiency. This approach not only supports current operations but also lays the foundation for future research and development advancements."

    "To help determine the unmet need for improved diagnostic tools to evaluate patients with nonspecific signs and/or symptoms (NSSS) and suspicion of cancer, we examined patient characteristics, diagnostic journey, and cancer incidence of patients with NSSS within The US Oncology Network (The Network), a secondary care community oncology setting. This retrospective, observational cohort study included patients aged &ge;40 years with &ge;1 NSSS in their problem list at their first visit within The Network (the index date) between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2020. Patients were followed longitudinally with electronic health record data for initial cancer diagnosis, new noncancer diagnosis, death, end of study observation period, or 12 months, whichever occurred first. Of 103,984 patients eligible for inclusion, 96,722 presented with only 1 NSSS at index date; 6537/103,984 (6.3%) were diagnosed with 1 primary cancer within 12 months after the index date; 3825/6537 (58.5%) with hematologic malignancy, and 2712/6537 (41.5%) with solid tumor. Among patients diagnosed with cancer (n = 6774), the median time to cancer diagnosis after their first visit within The Network was 5.13 weeks. This study provides a real-world perspective on cancer incidence in patients with NSSS referred to a secondary care setting and highlights the unmet need for improved diagnostic tools to improve cancer outcomes."

    "Technological advancements in autonomous robotics, including autonomous vehicles, have created new opportunities for innovative solutions to many everyday challenges. The impact of integrating robotic agents into real-world applications may be significantly enhanced by leveraging advancements in multi-agent autonomous systems. However, the coordination required in multi-agent systems demands complex motion planning to deconflict actions and prevent collisions of vehicles moving at increasingly high speeds. This thesis explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to autonomous robotics by teaching a central controller to navigate multiple agents across various environments without collisions. The simulated scenarios range from simple, obstacle-free environments to complex environments with obstacles configured to form narrow passageways or represent other complexities in dense urban environments. The findings demonstrate the potential of MARL to achieve high accuracy in navigating these different environments, highlighting the method's flexibility and adaptability across diverse settings and the resulting implications for applying MARL to real-world scenarios."

    "This study presents an approach to identifying underutilized urban spaces, focusing on parking areas, and explores potential reutilization strategies in Greater Boston. Under the milieu of the information age, global urbanization, and technological development, the prosperity of urban data serves as the new method to approach urban proposals. The city, as a multifaceted artifact, is examined through the lens of advanced data-driven techniques, particularly deep learning. With the computer vision model, the underused surface parking lots will be automatically detected according to historical satellite imageries, highlighting a misalignment between the current infrastructure and the actual urban needs. This study then leverages miscellaneous urban factors to analyze the parking patterns. Associated with the multimodal system, there are possibilities underlying the usage of redundant surface parking. Considering the high rents and housing situation, these spaces could be transformed into housing units or even mixed-used districts, to alleviate the housing crisis in Greater Boston."

  "summary": [
    "In 2023, Commercial Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) in the USA, comprising Light Water Reactors (LWRs) such as Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) and Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs), remained the largest single source of carbon-free energy. They provided approximately half of the nation\u2019s carbon-free electricity and under 20% of total electricity throughout the year. Ensuring the competitiveness of these nuclear assets is crucial for maintaining their role in providing dispatchable clean energy alongside renewable sources. The recent commissioning of Vogtle Units 3 and 4 marked the first new NPPs connected to the grid in over three decades, highlighting the high costs associated with nuclear technology and underscoring the need to improve their economic competitiveness. Optimizing the fuel cycle economics through enhanced core Loading Pattern (LP) is a key strategy to address this challenge. Since the 1960s, optimizing the LP for LWRs has been a major focus in nuclear engineering, but the large search space has posed significant difficulties. Computational methods from Stochastic Optimization (SO) have been used to tackle this issue, yet they often fail to outperform expert-designed solutions preferred by utilities. Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), a subset of Deep Learning focused on decision-making, has shown promise in surpassing human-expert solutions in fields such as gaming and robotics. This thesis investigates the use of RL to improve automated tools for solving the PWR LP optimization problem, with the goal of developing efficient decision-support tools for core designers to generate more economical loading patterns. We present a novel approach using deep RL to solve the LP problem and compare it with traditional SO-based methods. Our findings indicate that the LP problem benefits from a global search to rapidly identify promising directions, followed by a local search to efficiently exploit these directions and avoid local optima. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a type of RL algorithm, adapts its search capabilities with learnable policy weights, making it effective for both global and local searches, which contributes to its superiority over SO-based methods. Additionally, we introduce a new method called PEARL (Pareto Envelope Augmented with 3 Reinforcement Learning) to tackle multi-objective optimization challenges. PEARL demonstrates greater efficiency in identifying Pareto fronts without requiring additional designer intervention, compared to traditional single-objective scaling methods. Finally, we extend PEARL to a novel paradigm called physics-informed RL by integrating statistical techniques and physics knowledge to enhance algorithm performance. As problem complexity increases, classical methods sometimes fail to find feasible solutions. Incorporating physics-informed insights becomes crucial for discovering high-quality and diverse solutions more efficiently. These results highlight the potential of AI advancements in the nuclear field. A deep understanding of AI tools is essential to fully leverage their capabilities. Our approach achieved a cumulative benefit of over 4 $million per year per plant compared to using off-the-shelf AI solutions. While further work is needed to translate these theoretical benefits into real reactors, these algorithms promise to enhance the competitiveness of future nuclear fleets. In doing so, they could make a substantial contribution to achieving carbon neutrality by increasing the amount of clean electricity on the grid."

    "Expressive violin performance demands the coordination of multiple physical and physiological processes. Students, especially those engaged in infrequent private lessons, often struggle to manage these demands. Outside of lessons, they lack access to the resources and external feedback that technology has made readily available in other learning settings. In this study, we propose the Expressive Violin Performance Sensing (EVPS) system as a solution to this issue. The EVPS system uses low-cost and accessible electronic sensors to provide objective, quantitative insights into the physical and physiological aspects of a violinist\u2019s performance. Results from experimental trials reveal that the EVPS system provides relatively reliable data on expressive violin performance. While the general measures of physicality did not reveal significant differences between players of distinct skill levels, physiological and specific physical measurements aligned well with predictions. The successful utilization of low-cost sensors in the EVPS system highlights their potential for use in future performance analysis studies, challenging the precedent of relying on expensive, medical-grade systems."

    "G-Net is a neural network framework that implements g-computation, a causal inference method for making counterfactual predictions and estimating treatment effects under dynamic and time-varying treatment regimes. Two G-Net models have been successfully implemented: one that uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as its predictors, and one that uses transformer encoders (G-Transformer). However, one limitation of G-Net is that its counterfactual predictive density estimates do not take into account uncertainty about model parameter estimates. These uncertainty estimates are necessary for establishing confidence intervals around the effect estimation, enabling a robust assessment of whether the effects of two treatment options exhibit statistically significant differences. An important area of work is adding support for quantification of model uncertainty for conditional effect estimation. This thesis aims to add uncertainty quantification to both the RNN-based G-Net and the G-Transformer. To achieve this, we use two well-known techniques in uncertainty modeling, namely variational dropout and deep ensembling. We evaluate our methods using two simulated datasets based on mechanistic models. We demonstrate that G-Net and G-Transformer models with uncertainty quantification are better-calibrated and perform better for individual-level clinical decision making than their baseline counterparts."

    "Ab initio multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) and coupled cluster singles doubles and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] levels of theory were used to study ground and excited electronic states of HfCO. We report potential energy curves, dissociation energies (De), excitation energies, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and chemical bonding patterns of HfCO. The 3\u03a3\u2212 ground state of HfCO has an 1\u03c322\u03c321\u03c02 electron configuration and a \u223c30 kcal mol\u22121 dissociation energy with respect to its lowest-energy fragments Hf(3F) + CO(X1\u03a3+). We further evaluated the De of its isovalent HfCX (X = S, Se, Te, Po) series and observed that they increase linearly from the lighter HfCO to the heavier HfCPo with the dipole moment of the CX ligand. The same linear relationship was observed for TiCX and ZrCX. We utilized the CCSD(T) benchmark values of De, excitation energy, and ionization energy (IE) values to evaluate density functional theory (DFT) errors with 23 exchange\u2013correlation functionals spanning GGA, meta-GGA, global GGA hybrid, meta-GGA hybrid, range-separated hybrid, and double-hybrid functional families. The global GGA hybrid B3LYP and range-separated hybrid \u03c9B97X performed well at representing the ground state properties of HfCO (i.e., De and IE). Finally, we extended our DFT analysis to the interaction of a CO molecule with a Hf surface and observed that the surface chemisorption energy and the gas-phase molecular dissociation energy are very similar for some DFAs but not others, suggesting moderate transferability of the benchmarks on these molecules to the solid state."

    "For the past decade, online deliberation platforms like Polis have expanded the reach of deliberative democracy, which calls for political decisions to be based on the results of fair and balanced discussions among citizens, by enabling larger deliberations. However, as these discussions often generate a large volume of comments, which is infeasible for policymakers to thoroughly review, these platforms often include analysis algorithms that distill the conversation into a small set of comments, which policy-makers can use as the base of citizen input into decision-making. While Polis currently provides a clustering-analysis summary of the discussion, two newer aggregation algorithms, inspired by computational social choice theory and abstract argumentation theory, have recently been proposed. These algorithms seek to provide more representative (i.e. portraying all perspectives) and consistent (i.e. comments within a perspective do not oppose each other) summaries of the discussion, respectively. Still, though these newer algorithms may have theoretical advantages over Polis\u2019s current methods, they have yet to be evaluated in a real-world application. Through a randomized controlled trial of all three approaches using a nationally representative sample, we compare their practical effectiveness, as measured by participants\u2019 subjective experiences regarding how well these summaries represent their concerns. We find that the computational social choice-inspired algorithm consistently outperforms Polis\u2019s current methods in this regard, though future theoretical work is still needed to fully adapt this approach to a real-world setting."

    "In the last decade, the financial sector has changed significantly. The introduction of new technologies and mobile applications transformed the entire industry, leading to the rise of financial technology (fintech startups). Fintech startups offer a wide range of products/services, such as digital payments, Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL), crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending, etc. Middle East and North African (MENA) countries have seen significant growth in the number of fintech startups and the total investment value in these companies. For example, in Egypt, Fawry is the biggest payment service provider; it covers nearly 25% of Egyptian customers and has more than 3 million daily operations. Also, some fintech companies in MENA became unicorns, such as Tabby of Saudi Arabia and MNT-Halan of Egypt. The increased penetration of fintech in MENA countries has consistently raised concerns about data security, consumer protection, and financial stability that these companies can cause. This always raised a couple of questions for the financial sector authorities or regulators: how these authorities can increase the number of these companies to support financial inclusion and growth of financial sectors and, at the same time, alleviate the dangers and concerns that these fintech companies present. This thesis provides a comprehensive analysis of the growth of fintech startups in the MENA region, focusing on four countries: Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Jordan. Then, the study investigates the fintech regulations in these countries. This study aims to understand how recent regulations have impacted the growth of fintech startups through qualitative insights and case studies from four countries. The study reveals the following: First, Jordan's fintech regulations are still in their early stages. Despite having some fintech regulations, significant regulations such as data protection and cyber security laws still need to be made available. The absence of some fintech regulations might cause investors and entrepreneurs not to launch or expand their fintech businesses in Jordan. Second, in Egypt, the fintech regulations align with investors' and entrepreneurs' expectations; however, the economic conditions-budget deficit and currency fluctuations might hinder the growth of the fintech sector in Egypt. Third, for Saudi and UAE, the fintech ecosystem and regulations encouraged entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses and customers to increase the adoption of fintech products and services. The development of regulations, laws, and guidelines in both countries contributed to the growth of the fintech sector and, at the same time, safeguard customers."

    "Oral administration of plant-produced antigens were reported to be immuno-stimulatory in humans, potentially capable of conferring immunity from viral infection (specific for the viral antigen bioengineered for expression in plant). Use of antigen-containing plant products for oral (or sublingual) administration does not require purification. The plant \u201cpaste\u201d may be sufficient (?) for immunizing humans (and animals). Scientific evidence supports advocacy for oral administration of \u201craw\u201d plant-based products (sublingual) without purification. Implementing this proposal may accelerate the pace of global vaccination and preventive healthcare for less affluent communities by [0] eliminating the need for purification,[1] eliminating the need for \u201ccold\u201d supply chain logistics, [2] eliminating the dependency on medical professionals for vaccination and [3] eliminating supply chain fulfillment dependencies by growing the antigen-producing \u201cpotted plants\u201d in community gardens or at home, as a vaccine cottage industry. Communities may also brew the cottage industry for transgenic plants producing antigens as an entrepreneurial innovation endeavor and/or a social business for vaccines. The latter, built on pillars of ethical profitability, is expected to prioritize science as a service to society (SASSY) to improve access to global public goods with respect to health and healthcare. The economics of vaccination technology during the CoVID-19 pandemic (still in progress?) may be one of the gravest discontents of the 21st century from the perspective of people, healthcare access and ethical globalization. The public health alarm is not restricted to affluent OECD nations and affluence cannot mitigate the risks of future epidemics and pandemics. Vaccination and immunization, when possible, must be globally accessible and available to mitigate the threat from [1] worldwide transmission, [2] increasing virulence due to antigenic drift and [3] economic devastation which follows, naturally."

    "A theoretical study is made of the stability of propagating internal gravity wave modes along a horizontal stratified fluid layer bounded by rigid walls. The analysis is based on the Floquet eigenvalue problem for infinitesimal perturbations to a wave mode of small amplitude. The appropriate instability mechanism hinges on how the perturbation spatial scale relative to the basic-state wavelength, controlled by a parameter  \ud835\udf07, compares to the basic-state amplitude parameter,  \ud835\udf16 \u226a 1. For  \ud835\udf07=\ud835\udc42(1), the onset of instability arises due to perturbations that form resonant triads with the underlying wave mode. For short-scale perturbations such that  \ud835\udf07 \u226a 1 but  \ud835\udefc = \ud835\udf07/\ud835\udf16 \u226b 1, this triad resonance instability reduces to the familiar parametric subharmonic instability (PSI), where triads comprise fine-scale perturbations with half the basic-wave frequency. However, as  \ud835\udf07 is further decreased holding  \ud835\udf16 fixed, higher-frequency perturbations than these two subharmonics come into play, and when \ud835\udefc = \ud835\udc42(1) Floquet modes feature broadband spectrum. This broadening phenomenon is a manifestation of the advection of small-scale perturbations by the basic-wave velocity field. By working with a set of \u2018streamline coordinates\u2019 in the frame of the basic wave, this advection can be \u2018factored out\u2019. Importantly, when  \ud835\udefc = \ud835\udc42(1) PSI is replaced by a novel, multi-mode resonance mechanism which has a stabilising effect that provides an inviscid short-scale cut-off to PSI. The theoretical predictions are supported by numerical results from solving the Floquet eigenvalue problem for a mode-1 basic state."

    "The dynamic mechanics of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including gut contractions, variable pH, and degradative enzymes, significantly challenge the development of oral delivery systems for biologic drugs by compromising their reliable delivery and therapeutic efficacy. While recent advances in oral delivery systems offer improved absorption through tissue penetration, their clinical translation remains tenuous due to the uncertainty of actuation-based delivery in variable environments and inherent design complexity. Inspired by the compression-based toxin delivery system of the stonefish, we developed a simple oral delivery device that harnesses GI mechanics to reliably actuate and systemically deliver biologic drugs. By synchronizing device actuation with gut contractions, the device and tissue work in tandem to ensure the complete transfer of a loaded therapeutic from the device to the tissue, bypassing physical and biochemical barriers and maximizing absorption. Through ex vivo and in silico experiments, we engineered the geometry of the device to achieve safe and targeted injections in the gut. An ex vivo electromechanical simulation model revealed the effectiveness of gut contractions for device actuation, and extensive in vivo experiments involving minipigs demonstrated comparable biologic drug delivery efficacy to subcutaneous injection. Harnessing the dynamic mechanics of the GI tract to improve oral delivery could transform drug administration and significantly enhance the lives of many patients."

    "Several methods have been developed for generating 3D, in vitro, organ-on-chip models of human vasculature to study vascular function, transport, and tissue engineering. However, many of these existing models lack the hierarchical nature of the arterial-to-capillary-to-venous architecture that is key to capturing a more comprehensive view of the human microvasculature. Here, we present a perfusable, multi-compartmental model that recapitulates the three microvascular compartments to assess various physiological properties such as vessel permeability, vasoconstriction dynamics, and circulating cell arrest and extravasation. Viscous finger patterning and passive pumping create the larger arterial and venular lumens, while the smaller diameter capillary bed vessels are generated through self-assembly. These compartments anastomose and form a perfusable, hierarchical system that portrays the directionality of blood flow through the microvasculature. The addition of collagen channels reduces the apparent permeability of the central capillary region, likely by reducing leakage from the side channels, enabling more accurate measurements of vascular permeability\u2014an important motivation for this study. Furthermore, the model permits modulation of fluid flow and shear stress conditions throughout the system by using hydrostatic pressure heads to apply pressure differentials across either the arteriole or the capillary. This is a pertinent system for modeling circulating tumor or T cell dissemination and extravasation. Circulating cells were found to arrest in areas conducive to physical trapping or areas with the least amount of shear stress, consistent with hemodynamic or mechanical theories of metastasis. Overall, this model captures more features of human microvascular beds and is capable of testing a broad variety of hypotheses."

    "What potentials does curiosity bear for education? Some characterizations portray curiosity as self-motivated search for answers, a drive conformable with conventional education\u2019s imperative for correct answers. For participants in this study, curiosity engages them with their relationships to the world. This article examines curiosity from along my developing in learning and teaching. While school settings limited or excluded curiosity, both for me as a student and as a teacher, it relates how I encountered the value of curiosity in examples of my father, mentors, and other experiences. Beginning with a gradual and uncertain process, I transitioned from being an educator bound by conventional expectations, to a teacher-researcher creating environments where learners\u2019 expressions and acts of curiosity constitute the educational work that I actively support and seek to extend. Curiosity in the classroom generates trajectories and engagements that differ from conventional instruction. This article demonstrates and researches the educational work of curiosity, through contextual narratives from my teaching as a beginner at accommodating students\u2019 curiosity, and from my recent teaching, where students and I more fully commit to the relational and educational possibilities of encouraging curiosity. In facilitating these experiences, I apply the research pedagogy of Eleanor Duckworth, \u2018critical exploration in the classroom\u2019. In narratives from my teaching, curiosity propels exploring relationships among: floating and sinking; trees, leaves and acorns; dye in water; maple sap sweetness; bubbles in water; and permutations of objects. Provocations from historical works include: Leonardo\u2019s drawings; Hooke\u2019s and Ram\u00f3n y Cajal\u2019s microscopy; Keats\u2019 \u201cnegative capability\u201d; Dewey\u2019s reflections on interdependency among children and adults; and children\u2019s creations in Reggio Emilia preschools. As experience builds through curiosity, relations deepen in ways simultaneously unadulterated\u2014exploring unconstrained\u2014and unchildlike\u2014sustaining commitment. Participants characterize our process as having \u201cNo End Goal\u201d imposed from outside themselves, unlike formal instruction that suppresses personal curiosity in favor of pre-ordained goals. The natural world, opened by curiosity, embodies ever-emerging relationships that accommodate concurrent widening and deepening of learners\u2019 involvement and realizations. Learning experiences happening through relationships are infused with emotion, aesthetic qualities, and social connections and concerns."

    "Ceramic-supported metal catalysts formed by exsolution of metal nanoparticles from perovskites are promising materials for energy and chemical conversion applications. However, our incomplete understanding of the exsolution mechanism presents a roadblock to engineering exsolution nanoparticle properties. We investigated the influence of reduction conditions on the properties of Ni nanoparticles exsolved on the fracture surfaces of Sr0.8La0.1Ca0.1Ti0.94Ni0.06O3\u2212\u03b4. We first carried out exsolution at 25 different temperatures and oxygen chemical potentials. We found that reduction at lower temperatures and moderate oxygen chemical potentials produced more numerous, smaller nanoparticles. We then fit our data to a LaMer nucleation model where the number of nanoparticles formed depends on Ni surface segregation, reduction of Ni-rich surfaces, and nanoparticle growth. Finally, we demonstrated prediction of the energetics of these processes with density functional theory calculations. Our experiments and modelling build understanding of the exsolution mechanism and are a step towards computational design of supported metal catalysts made via exsolution."

    "We report a convenient bifunctional diazirine reagent that is capable of photochemically modifying inert polymers, particularly those used in fibers and textiles for ballistics and blast protective gear, such as para-aramid and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). The reagent's structure features a trifluoromethyl diazirine group as a precursor to a carbene that binds the textile surface. On the reagent's other terminus, a benzyl bromide group acts as a site accessible for substitution reactions. As a bench-stable liquid, this bifunctional diazirine can be prepared on gram-scale quantities and rapidly activates under long-wave UV light. A series of fabrics made from Kevlar, Spectra, Dyneema, etc. were functionalized with this diazirine reagent, then subsequently dyed by binding nucleophilic dyes. The resulting coloration was found to be robust and colorfast with respect to water, organic solvent, and simulated laundering with detergent, and the strength of the fibers or fabrics was retained through the dyeing process, as shown through TGA and mechanical break testing. Overall, this carbene-based method provides a general, mild strategy for the covalent attachment of small molecules to textiles made from inert polymers, particularly para-aramids and UHMWPE, as well as nylon and fiber blends of these materials, and has potential use in next-generation protective outerwear."

    "This dissertation examines the diatom\u2014a microorganism found ubiquitously from oceans to kitchen countertops\u2014as a resonant factor in understanding modernity. From the early 19th century to the mid-20th century, rapid advances in optical microscopy dramatically unveiled the microbial world, during which diatoms, owing to their astonishing biological properties, forms, and material possibilities, became the subject of wonderment by a diverse group of naturalists, artists, and architects. I contend that microbial ubiquity constitutes a crucial but often overlooked aspect of environmental history, which architecture has consistently failed to account for. \r\n\t\r\nThe narrative progresses from early fascination with the diatom\u2019s aesthetic potential to geologists\u2019 more serious-minded efforts, laying the foundations for Richard Neutra\u2019s (1892\u20131970) insistence that the diatom was critical to a new type of modern architecture. Through the case studies of Marquis Panciatichi d\u2019Aragona (1813\u20131897) and Jacob Whitman Bailey (1811\u20131857), among others, I explore how diatom-influenced works from the 19th to early 20th centuries underpinned a transboundary dialogue on the microbial and its architectural imaginations. This perusal historicizes the theoretical and technological conditions that made possible the emergence of modernist views of nature, epitomized by Neutra\u2019s philosophy on environmental psychology and realism through his early 20th-century proposal to integrate diatoms into the very fabric of modern living spaces. \r\n\t\r\nThis dissertation examines diatoms within shifting epistemological frameworks, tracking their transition from scientific specimens to motifs in visual culture. It investigates how unseen natural elements were disseminated, accumulated, and manifested into distinctly perceivable forms, revealing that the understanding of diatoms expanded from isolated, object-focused studies to a concern for environmental relationships and geological transitions. Filling the world was not some grand narrative of human will but the disorienting, puzzling, and even frightful everywhere-ness of microbiality. The intersection of diatoms with architecture changed from aesthetics and form to a deeper engagement with sites and land, following the transformative reconception of the thickness of the earth\u2019s surface. This dissertation reveals a condition of knowledge that architecturally and psychologically rewrote nature as an encounter of biological (un)consciousness and technological actualization."

    "Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory of quarks and gluons, whose interactions can be described by a local SU(3) gauge symmetry with charges called \u201ccolor quantum numbers\u201d, is reviewed; the goal of this review is to provide advanced Ph.D. students a comprehensive handbook, helpful for their research. When QCD was \u201cdiscovered\u201d 50\u00a0years ago, the idea that quarks could exist, but not be observed, left most physicists unconvinced. Then, with the discovery of charmonium in 1974 and the explanation of its excited states using the Cornell potential, consisting of the sum of a Coulomb-like attraction and a long range linear confining potential, the theory was suddenly widely accepted. This paradigm shift is now referred to as the November revolution.

Lattice QCD (LQCD), numerical calculations on a discretized space-time lattice, is discussed in detail, the dynamics of the QCD vacuum is visualized, and the expected spectra of mesons and baryons are displayed. Progress in lattice calculations of the structure of nucleons and of quantities related to the phase diagram of dense and hot (or cold) hadronic matter are reviewed. Methods and examples of how to calculate hadronic corrections to weak matrix elements on a lattice are outlined. The wide variety of analytical approximations currently in use, and the accuracy of these approximations, are reviewed. These methods range from the Bethe\u2013Salpeter, Dyson\u2013Schwinger coupled relativistic equations, which are formulated in both Minkowski or Euclidean spaces, to expansions of multi-quark states in a set of basis functions using light-front coordinates, to the AdS/QCD method that imbeds 4-dimensional QCD in a 5-dimensional deSitter space, allowing confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking to be described in a novel way. Models that assume the number of colors is very large, i.e. make use of the large \r\n                \r\n                  \r\n                \r\n                $$N_c$$\r\n                \r\n                  \r\n                    N\r\n                    c\r\n                  \r\n                \r\n              -limit, give unique insights. Many other techniques that are tailored to specific problems, such as perturbative expansions for high energy scattering or approximate calculations using the operator product expansion are discussed. The very powerful effective field theory techniques that are successful for low energy nuclear systems (chiral effective theory), or for non-relativistic systems involving heavy quarks, or the treatment of gluon exchanges between energetic, collinear partons encountered in jets, are discussed. The spectroscopy of mesons and baryons has played an important historical role in the development of QCD. The famous X,Y,Z states \u2013 and the discovery of pentaquarks \u2013 have revolutionized hadron spectroscopy; their status and interpretation are reviewed as well as recent progress in the identification of glueballs and hybrids in light-meson spectroscopy. These exotic states add to the spectrum of expected \r\n                \r\n                  \r\n                \r\n                $$q{{\\bar{q}}}$$\r\n                \r\n                  \r\n                    q\r\n                    \r\n                      \r\n                        q\r\n                      \r\n                      \r\n                        \u00af\r\n                      \r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                \r\n               mesons and qqq baryons. The progress in understanding excitations of light and heavy baryons is discussed. The nucleon as the lightest baryon is discussed extensively, its form factors, its partonic structure and the status of the attempt to determine a three-dimensional picture of the parton distribution. An experimental program to study the phase diagram of QCD at high temperature and density started with fixed target experiments in various laboratories in the second half of the 1980s, and then, in this century, with colliders. QCD thermodynamics at high temperature became accessible to LQCD, and numerical results on chiral and deconfinement transitions and properties of the deconfined and chirally restored form of strongly interacting matter, called the Quark\u2013Gluon Plasma (QGP), have become very precise by now. These results can now be confronted with experimental data that are sensitive to the nature of the phase transition. There is clear evidence that the QGP phase is created. This phase of QCD matter can already be characterized by some properties that indicate, within a temperature range of a few times the pseudocritical temperature, the medium behaves like a near ideal liquid. Experimental observables are presented that demonstrate deconfinement. High and ultrahigh density QCD matter at moderate and low temperatures shows interesting features and new phases that are of astrophysical relevance. They are reviewed here and some of the astrophysical implications are discussed. Perturbative QCD and methods to describe the different aspects of scattering processes are discussed. The primary parton\u2013parton scattering in a collision is calculated in perturbative QCD with increasing complexity. The radiation of soft gluons can spoil the perturbative convergence, this can be cured by resummation techniques, which are also described here. Realistic descriptions of QCD scattering events need to model the cascade of quark and gluon splittings until hadron formation sets in, which is done by parton showers. The full event simulation can be performed with Monte Carlo event generators, which simulate the full chain from the hard interaction to the hadronic final states, including the modelling of non-perturbative components. The contribution of the LEP experiments (and of earlier collider experiments) to the study of jets is reviewed. Correlations between jets and the shape of jets had allowed the collaborations to determine the \u201ccolor factors\u201d \u2013 invariants of the SU(3) color group governing the strength of quark\u2013gluon and gluon\u2013gluon interactions. The calculated jet production rates (using perturbative QCD) are shown to agree precisely with data, for jet energies spanning more than five orders of magnitude. The production of jets recoiling against a vector boson, \r\n                \r\n                  \r\n                \r\n                $$W^\\pm $$\r\n                \r\n                  \r\n                    W\r\n                    \u00b1\r\n                  \r\n                \r\n               or Z, is shown to be well understood. The discovery of the Higgs boson was certainly an important milestone in the development of high-energy physics. The couplings of the Higgs boson to massive vector bosons and fermions that have been measured so far support its interpretation as mass-generating boson as predicted by the Standard Model. The study of the Higgs boson recoiling against hadronic jets (without or with heavy flavors) or against vector bosons is also highlighted. Apart from the description of hard interactions taking place at high energies, the understanding of \u201csoft QCD\u201d is also very important. In this respect, Pomeron \u2013 and Odderon \u2013 exchange, soft and hard diffraction are discussed. Weak decays of quarks and leptons, the quark mixing matrix and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon are processes which are governed by weak interactions. However, corrections by strong interactions are important, and these are reviewed. As the measured values are incompatible with (most of) the predictions, the question arises: are these discrepancies first hints for New Physics beyond the Standard Model? This volume concludes with a description of future facilities or important upgrades of existing facilities which improve their luminosity by orders of magnitude. The best is yet to come!"

    "In the context of quench detection systems for fusion superconducting magnets, temperature sensors based on optical fibers provide an effective solution for rapid, distributed measurement, with low sensitivity to electromagnetic interference. At the cryogenic temperatures and high radiation doses associated with this application, however, optical fibers undergo radiation-induced attenuation (RIA): light-absorbing point defects form within the silica glass structure, reducing the longevity and effectiveness of these sensors. In this work, we investigate the underlying microscopic defects and mechanisms of RIA and assess strategies for mitigation, namely, annealing via heat treatment (thermal annealing) and annealing via light propagation through the fiber (optical annealing, or \u201cphotobleaching\u201d). We design a white light absorption spectroscopy setup with in-situ irradiation and optical annealing, working at liquid nitrogen temperature and different post-irradiation warm-up rates. For the pure silica core and F-doped cladding fibers studied, the RIA spectrum obtained is decomposed into known radiation-induced defect absorption bands, highlighting the key role of self-trapped holes in RIA at telecommunication wavelengths. Furthermore, absorption spectroscopy experiments are performed to show that thermal annealing at liquid nitrogen temperature is negligible, validating the transferability of the experimental results obtained at 77 K to 20 K applications. The decomposition of RIA into different defect contributions is supported by cold post-irradiation electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of fiber preform fragments, which reveals the presence of two types of paramagnetic centers: self-trapped holes and E'_gamma centers. The post-irradiation transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) technique is adapted to glass samples with continuous cooling at liquid nitrogen temperature and in-situ optical annealing. With this technique, we could observe the changes in thermal and acoustic properties resulting from the evolution of defect populations, with the potential to complement other experimental techniques to better understand RIA build-up and annealing kinetics. To improve the modeling of thermo-optical annealing, we propose future experiments including isothermal annealing tests and a larger exploration of optical annealing parameters. Our RIA build-up and annealing tests can help companies aiming to operate optical fibers under irradiation at cryogenic temperatures optimize their heat treatments to restore fiber transmission and the prevention of RIA during operation."

    "The sheet metal manufacturing industry, with its rich history and legacy, continues to seek innovative methods to enhance automation and reduce costs in an increasingly competitive market. Design for Manufacturability & Assembly (DFMA) has emerged as a strategy to simplify product designs, thereby improving manufacturing eOiciency and reducing production costs. This research suggests the use of extruded steel profiles as an alternative to traditional sheet metal components that pose challenges for automation, particularly heavy gauge narrow channels. Additionally, it advocates for replacing manual press brake operations with advanced automated tube laser technology. The proposed shift not only simplifies the manufacturing process but also aligns with the broader goal of global cost reduction and process standardization, which are essential for enhancing New Product Introduction (NPI) eOiciencies. The findings demonstrate that maximizing the application of tube laser technology across a diverse range of channels and products can lead to significant cost savings, ranging from 49% to 79%, with a payback period of less than two years. Even under fluctuating raw material prices, the tube laser method remains economically advantageous. Moreover, redesigning products to enhance compatibility with tube laser technology has shown to increase the automation compatibility of an example product to 100%, underscoring the importance of incorporating DFMA principles from the early stages of product design."

    "It is known that inertial lift forces can lead to particle focusing in channel flows; yet oscillatory straining effects have also been suggested as a mechanism for particle focusing in wavy channels. To explore the synergy between these two mechanisms, we analytically and experimentally investigate the focusing behaviour of rigid neutrally buoyant particles in a wavy channel. We decompose the particle-free channel flow into a primary Poiseuille flow and secondary eddies induced by the waviness. We calculate the perturbation of the particle on the particle-free flow and the resulting lateral lift force exerted on the particle using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. This yields a zeroth-order lift force arising from the Poiseuille flow and a first-order lift force due to the waviness of the channel. We further incorporate the inertial lift force into the Maxey\u2013Riley equation and simulate particle trajectories in wavy channels. The interactions between the zeroth-order lift force and the particle-free flow largely determine the focusing locations. Experiments in wavy channels with varying amplitudes at channel Reynolds numbers ranging from 5 to 250 are consistent with the predictions of the focusing locations, which are mainly governed by the channel Reynolds number as well as the competition between the inertial lift and the oscillatory straining effects."

    "Detailed chemical kinetic models are indispensable tools for unraveling the complexities of industrial and environmental chemistry systems. Many important industrial and environmental chemistries involve thousands of species and hundreds of thousands of complex pathways, which are difficult to resolve manually. To address this challenge, automatic mechanism generation software has been developed. Previous studies have demonstrated the promising quantitative agreements of automatically generated mechanisms with experimental data. However, previous studies have primarily focused on small molecules in single-phase systems, overlooking the complexities of multiphase systems and macromolecules commonly found in industrial and environmental processes. This thesis introduces advancements in three key areas of automatic mechanism generation: Part I extends the current framework of automatic mechanism generation to tackle the longstanding issue of polymer fouling in the industrial system. Two detailed kinetic models are presented: one for anaerobic fouling and the other for aerobic fouling in distillation columns. Modeling innovations are introduced, which allow one to construct models including thousands of chemical reactions occurring in the liquid and film phases, vapor-liquid equilibria of hundreds of molecules, transport between the phases, and flows between the trays. All of these factors significantly affect the fouling rate. Most of the critical model parameters are derived from quantum chemistry calculations. The modeling method is validated using experimental film growth measurements made with a quartz-crystal microbalance. These models clarify the mechanistic details of the fouling process. Part II develops machine learning models for predicting thermochemical parameters in gas and liquid phases. A decision tree model based on subgraph isomorphism for gas-phase radical thermochemistry is presented. The model demonstrates improved accuracy compared to the existing empirical model and reliable uncertainty estimates for both interpolation and extrapolation tasks. Additionally, the effectiveness of active learning for building models for solvation-free energy is explored under various compositions of initial training sets and uncertainty estimation methods for data acquisition. The possibility of aiding data acquisition with unsupervised learning for active learning is also assessed. Part III adds new features and enhances the performance of multiple packages under the Reaction Mechanism Generator software suite, originally developed by the MIT Green Group. New tools are developed to facilitate thermochemical data augmentation, multiphase 3 simulation for automatic mechanism generation, and the automatic implementation of quasisteady state assumptions during the simulation of detailed kinetic models. A new species and reaction selection algorithm is developed to enable the automatic generation of mechanisms for molecular growth systems. Various speed improvement techniques are applied to improve both the simulation speed and sensitivity analysis of large-scale detailed kinetic models. By addressing these key areas, this thesis contributes to the advancement of automatic mechanism generation, paving the way for more accurate and efficient modeling of complex chemical systems."

    "There are many different approaches to beamforming and interferer cancellation. The earliest methods of beamforming assumed prior knowledge of the receive array geometry and of the incoming signal directions. This information is normally found via array calibration. Blind source separation methods do not require this information and therefore are more robust to array calibration errors. Traditional blind source separation methods generally leverage some intrinsic characteristic of the signal, such as constant envelope properties or second or higher order statistics. Traditional blind source separation methods such as CMA, SOBI, JADE, and FastICA tend to be highly effective at beamforming datasets with moderate to large sample supports, but they do not perform well when they only have access to a limited number of data samples. They also bear the disadvantage that the appropriate algorithm must be selected based on the properties of the expected signal. Machine learningbased methods are of interest because they show promise in low sample support regimes, and because they offer the possibility of a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 solution that can adaptively recognize and exploit different signal features. This thesis describes the performance of two machine learning-informed beamforming methods \u2014 Classification-Based Transfer Learning (CBTL) [1] and Denoising-Based Transfer Learning (DBTL). CBTL and DBTL are evaluated with respect to each other and with respect to traditional blind beamforming methods across a variety of signal detection environments, and are found to offer superior or equivalent performance in a majority of environments."

    "Macroeconomic events are putting unprecedented pressure on the warehouse industry. Among these are labor shortages, increased operating costs, and the desire for greater customization and higher throughput from these facilities. Focused on these challenges and strategic issues for warehouse applications, this thesis investigates the obstacles to implementing robotic automation in supply chains. The thesis explores this environment and the lens of using three common integration methods. These are the traditional purchase, lease, and emerging robotic-as-a-service (RaaS) model. With these methods in scope, the study incorporates a multicriteria decision-making framework (MCDM) that is built based on an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and combined with the technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS). From this framework, the research identifies key decision criteria and their impact on selecting the most suitable integration strategy for automation.\r\n\r\nThrough a literature review, the study identified the essential criteria for the project design decision. These include infrastructure requirements, system capabilities, usability, provider reputation, project duration, and the total cost of ownership. We then gained insight from industry professionals familiar with automation integration using a focused field study. Furthermore, we underlined practical issues and general opinions on the criteria and how well they correspond to their integration plans. The results highlight notable trade-offs in the decision criteria, emphasizing the need for a more tailored strategy to make automation adoption more efficient.\r\n\r\nThis thesis provides an effective decision support system to guide the choice of appropriate automation solutions. It helps clarify how decision makers give the most importance to different criteria when implementing robotic automation. The research findings offer helpful details for practitioners navigating the challenging warehouse automation environment. This, therefore, encourages better informed and more efficient decision-making procedures."

    "This study presents an analytical tool for characterizing a wide swath of the designspace for time-variant electrodialysis reversal brackish water desalination (TEDR) while avoiding the computation time oft required by mechanistic models of electrodialysis reversal (EDR) and time-variant processes. In place of explicit computation, this paper proposes a simplifying assumptions to simulate desalination power and production rate of a TEDR process without explicit computation, enabling rapid year-long simulation and system optimization. The output of the model is compared to experimental data from a pilot TEDR system and found to have good agreement between desalination power and production rate. Disagreement between the modeled and experimental pressure losses suggesting additional losses in the experiment which may be accounted for in future work. Two case studies, one case for potable water in the American Southwest and another case for irrigation water in the Middle-East and North Africa (MENA) region, compare the results from 54 optimized systems. The results illustrate the complexity of system design and selection, elucidating tradeoffs between different models of electrodialysis (EDR) stacks, operating modes, and system configurations. The output of this model will enable system designers to confidently design and implement cost-effective TEDR systems to combat rising global freshwater scarcity."

    "Technological advances in the thorium fuel cycle and other advanced reactor concepts suggest their possible commercialization for nuclear power use in the next ten years. Although the thorium cycle shares many aspects with the uranium and plutonium fuel cycles, it introduces the requirement for the nondestructive assay of multiple isotopes (\u00b2\u00b38U, \u00b2\u00b3\u00b2Th, \u00b2\u00b3\u00b3U, \u00b2\u00b3\u2075U, or \u00b2\u00b3\u2079Pu) in varied concentrations and chemical or physical forms. Current methodologies used for safeguarding the uranium and plutonium fuel cycles are either unsuitable for quantifying many of these isotopes or lack the ability to differentiate between them effectively. This work presents an experimental evaluation of a portable Neutron Resonance Capture Analysis (NRCA) system sensitive to isotopes with neutron capture resonances in the epithermal range (1-100 eV). NRCA is a technique traditionally used for nuclear data collection and nondestructive assay of archaeological materials, typically conducted at large accelerator facilities with beamlines in excess of ten meters. This research miniaturizes the system to a two-meter beamline using a portable deuterium-tritium neutron generator. It builds upon the foundation of a portable Neutron Resonance Transmission Analysis (NRTA) system, utilizing capture gamma rays to generate a signal, in contrast to the neutron transmission measurements of NRTA. The NRCA technique is evaluated in this novel, portable configuration first using nonradioactive samples for optimization and then progressing to depleted uranium and thorium salt samples. Through a research partnership with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the technique was tested using highly enriched uranium, 233U and high-assay, low-enrichment uranium (HALEU) samples. Field portability tests demonstrated its ability to operate safely in field conditions, with operator doses remaining well within occupational limits. The system was able to identify multiple mid- and high-Z materials by reconstructing their neutron resonance profiles in experiments as brief as 20 minutes. It successfully differentiated between nuclear fuel cycle isotopes in composite samples as small as 2 grams, with limited success in quantifying the areal densities of uranium and thorium. These results suggest that NRCA, especially when used in concert with NRTA and other neutron-interrogation techniques, has the potential to rapidly and nondestructively quantify and characterize isotopes of interest in support of safeguards material accountancy."

    "Minimally verbal adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (mvASD) experience significant speech production challenges linked to impaired motor skills. Despite the prevalence of these speech difficulties, the underlying motor mechanisms remain poorly understood. This thesis investigates the neuromuscular activity associated with speech motor movement in mvASD using surface electromyography (sEMG). By capturing and analyzing sEMG signals with 8 electrodes from key facial muscles during speech production tasks, this study provides insights into the distinct motor patterns exhibited by mvASD individuals compared to neurotypical controls. The sEMG data was collected while 25 participants, including 10 mvASD individuals and 15 neurotypical controls performed a series of carefully designed speech tasks. Features such as Root Mean Square (RMS) values, Pearson correlation coefficients, and eigenvalues from auto and cross correlation matrices were extracted to measure muscle activation and coordination complexity. The results reveal that mvASD individuals exhibit higher RMS values and greater synchronization between sEMG channels, indicating stronger muscle activation and tighter coupling among facial muscles. Furthermore, the analysis of eigenvalues suggests lower complexity in motor coordination among mvASD participants, reflecting fewer degrees of freedom in muscle control. These findings were supported by classification models, which demonstrated that features from diadochokinetic tasks were more effective in distinguishing mvASD from neurotypical individuals."

    "Recent advancements in text-to-image generation models have sparked a growing interest in using synthesized training data to improve few-shot learning performance. Prevailing approaches treat all generated data as uniformly important, neglecting the fact that the quality of generated images varies across different domains, datasets, and methods of generation. Using poor-quality images can hurt learning performance. In this work, we present Uncertaininclusive Contrastive Learning (UniCon), a novel contrastive loss function that incorporates uncertainty weights for synthetic images during training. Extending the framework of supervised contrastive learning, we add a learned hyperparameter that weights the synthetic input images per class, adjusting the influence of synthetic images during the training process. We evaluate the effectiveness of UniCon-learned representations against traditional supervised contrastive learning, both with and without synthetic images. Across three different finegrained classification datasets, we find that the learned representation space generated by the UniCon loss function leads to significantly improved downstream classification performance in comparison to supervised contrastive learning baselines."

    "Sr(Ti,Fe)O3\u2212y perovskite solid solutions are relevant functional materials for energy conversion and electronic devices such as solid oxide fuel and photoelectrochemical cells, electrolyzers, oxygen sensors, resistive random access memories or synaptic transistors. The Raman spectra and vibrational characteristics of the Sr(Ti,Fe)O3\u2212y materials class are suitable for describing their defect chemistry and the iron valence state, which governs a multitude of its mixed ionic\u2013electronic transport and other characteristics. We synthesize a standard range of compositions containing 1\u201375 mol% of iron including the end members in the form of macrocrystalline bulk pellets, nanocrystalline poly- and single crystalline thin films. Through the change in both iron substitution level and microstructure, we directly see the effect of defect chemistry such as its phase, transition metal ion valence and oxygen nonstoichiometry on the Raman spectra. These are discussed in terms of in and ex situ experiments under oxidizing/reducing atmosphere. In contrast to long range structural X-ray diffraction measurements, Raman spectroscopy provides valuable insights into oxygen vacancy ordering and oxygen nonstoichiometry for the Sr(Ti,Fe)O3\u2212y material class."

    "Recent advances in intact tissue processing and imaging have enabled the generation of whole brain microscopy data at subcellular resolution, revealing intricate morphological details of cells at unprecedented scales. Given that cellular morphology is strongly linked to distinct functional states of cells, in-depth morphological analysis of such data offers immense potential for understanding their roles in brain development and disease. However, the lack of scalable computational techniques poses a substantial challenge in achieving comprehensive morphological characterization. To efficiently and accurately analyze cellular morphology, we need to process terabyte-scale three-dimensional (3D) data, which inevitably complicates downstream analysis workflows with existing methods.\r\n\r\nTo address the challenge, we developed an end-to-end scalable framework that seamlessly strings each step of the analysis pipeline together, enabling comprehensive fluorescence microscopy data analysis. The framework, termed MorPheT (Morphology Phenotyping Tool), serves as an all-in-one solution, offering a suite of analysis modules spanning from image pre-processing to precise cell detection, atlas alignment, morphological phenotyping, and interactive visualizations. MorPheT employs an ensemble method using both supervised and unsupervised approaches to maximize feature learning for unbiased morphological characterization. A novel deep neural network (ALNet) was designed to capture the long-range contextual dependencies inherent in 3D training data during supervised learning. Unsupervised learning leverages complementary features from the supervised approach, demonstrating the powerful synergy of this ensemble method.\r\n\r\nWe applied MorPheT to two main projects. First, we profiled brain-resident macrophages (BRMs) and created the first fetal mouse brain atlases across multiple developmental stages, revealing distinct regional growth patterns of BRMs throughout development. We also demonstrated MorPheT\u2019s effectiveness in characterizing microglia distribution patterns and morphological properties brain-wide in both control and neurodegeneration mouse brains. In the second project, we investigated cFos+ cells in a memory engram study, showcasing MorPheT\u2019s utility for brain-wide analysis of engram cells. By examining regions hypothesized to hold memory engrams for contextual fear conditioning memory, we identified brain regions where engrams for a specific memory are distributed. Taken together, MorPheT is a powerful tool for cell profiling and mapping across the brain, and we anticipate it will help democratize computational analysis for large-scale microscopy datasets, making advanced analytical approaches more accessible to the broader scientific community."

    "Surface charge is a critical feature of microbes that affects their interactions with other cells and their environment. Because bacterial surface charge is difficult to measure directly, it is typically indirectly inferred through zeta potential measurements. Existing tools to perform such characterization are either costly and ill-suited for non-spherical samples or rely on microfluidic techniques requiring expensive fabrication equipment or specialized facilities. Here, we report the application of commercially available PMMA microfluidic chips and open-source data analysis workflows for facile electrokinetic characterization of particles and cells after prior zeta potential measurement with a Zetasizer for calibration. Our workflows eliminate the need for microchannel fabrication, increase measurement reproducibility, and make zeta potential measurements more accessible. This novel methodology was tested with functionalized 1 \u03bcm and 2 \u03bcm polystyrene beads as well as Escherichia coli MG1655 strain. Measured zeta potentials for these samples were in agreement with literature values obtained by conventional measurement methods. Taken together, our data demonstrate the power of this workflow to broadly enable critical measurements of particle and bacterial zeta potential for numerous applications."

    "For people without programming experience, integrating their work into the main project forms a common bottleneck in video game development. Particularly for dialogue writing, existing approaches for moving the text into the codebase are either highly tedious or excessively heavyweight for faster paced projects. Given that writers often initially produce loosely-formatted scripts, this thesis describes Game-DAP, an adaptive parsing system that accounts for the variation in individual dialogue writing styles. Examinations of pre-existing systems and a survey conducted on developers form a basis for a syntactic model of the information commonly encapsulated by dialogue scripts. This model lends itself to a design for the parsing process used by Game-DAP, which aims to provide as much flexibility to writers as possible with those assumptions as a baseline. User testing results informed the evaluation of the system, focusing on its accuracy, flexibility, and accessibility from the perspective of various authors. Although this analysis revealed several classes of inputs that Game-DAP struggles to process with full correctness, the more successful cases and instances of positive feedback suggest that a refined approach to this kind of domain-specific parsing could provide great value in the creative writing process of game dialogue."

    "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a crucial technology in the mission to achieve NetZero carbon emissions by midcentury. By capturing and storing CO2 from large industrial sources and power plants, CCS mitigates the impact of existing industrial activities while maintaining energy security and economic stability. The study underscores the necessity of a systematic approach to CCS system design and development to meet stakeholder requirements. It highlights the versatility of CCS in addressing emissions across various sectors, its ability to be retrofitted to existing infrastructure, and its potential for immediate emissions reduction compared to the longer timelines required for integrating renewable energy sources.\r\nThis study analyzes CCS systems holistically, identifying primary components and alternative options for capture, transport, storage, and utilization. It reveals that the transport type significantly impacts system utility, with pipelines being the most effective. The analysis also indicates that CCS systems capturing CO2 from power plants, ammonia, and chemical production facilities and utilizing onshore pipelines and saline aquifers offer high utility and low cost. The Gulf Coast and Permian & Midcontinent regions show better performance due to existing infrastructure and storage capacity. The study emphasizes the benefits of staged CCS development for broader deployment, technology maturation, and cost recovery. Sensitivity analyses suggest that future technology advances could further improve CCS system performance and economic viability."

    "Automated extraction of structured information from chemistry literature is vital for maintaining up-to-date databases for use in data-driven chemistry. However, comprehensive extractions require reasoning across multiple modalities and the flexibility to generalize across different styles of articles. Our work on OpenChemIE presents a multimodal system that reasons across text, tables, and figures to parse reaction data. In particular, our system is able to infer structures in substrate scope diagrams as well as align reactions with their metadata defined elsewhere. In addition, we explore the chemistry information extraction potential of Vision Language Models (VLM), which allow powerful large language models to leverage visual understanding. Our findings indicate that VLMs still require additional work in order to meet the performance of our bespoke models."

    "Biopharmaceutical products constitute a significant portion of the global bioeconomy. Compared to traditional synthetic small-molecule drugs, recombinant therapeutic proteins offer advantages like enhanced specificity and reduced side effects, and there has been tremendous growth in their innovation thanks to modern DNA technologies and AI-driven algorithms. While mammalian platforms such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells are commonly used for their high production titer and capability for complex post-translational modifications, thier high cost of goods manufactured can greatly constrain biopharmaceutical global accessibility. The yeast Komagataella phaffii is the prime candidate for next-generation biomanufacturing for reasons including simpler host biology, reduced time to market, and better sustainability. Nevertheless, product quality, such as size/charge variants and non-human glycosylation, can be of major concern for proteins secreted from this host organism. This thesis explores three different engineering approaches aimed at improving the quality of both aglycosylated and glycosylated proteins, with a particular focus on monoclonal antibodies, the leading class of protein biopharmaceuticals by both sales and innovation. Firstly, we demonstrated significant quality improvements through molecular sequence engineering of aglycosylated monoclonal antibody backbones. By making informed, conservative mutations to two or three amino acid residues, we greatly reduced product-related variants from proteolysis and N-terminal variations. We further showed the comparability between yeast- and CHO-secreted products, providing a framework for rapid product development with this unconventional yeast. Secondly, we applied CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology to humanize the glycosylation pathway of K. phaffii. We achieved homogeneous G0 glycosylation on a reporter peptide by resolving a previously unreported synthetic lethality via a transcriptomics-informed approach. Key challenges for monoclonal antibody glycosylation were also identified through further comprehensive pathway engineering. Lastly, we examined the performance of glycoengineered K. phaffii strains under varied process conditions. Employing a machine learning algorithm, we improved the desired glycan abundance on a subunit vaccine candidate. The process-robustness of engineered strains suggests the potential of this host as a viable commercial biomanufacturing host."

    "The vane-in-cup (VIC) geometry has been widely used for the rheological characterization of yield-stress fluids because it minimizes slip effects at the liquid/solid interface of the rotating geometry and reduces sample damage during the loading process. However, severe kinematic limitations arising from the spatial complexity of mixed shear and extensional flow have been identified for quantitative rheometrical measurements in complex fluids. Recently, vanes with fractal cross sections have been suggested as alternatives for accurate rheometry of elastoviscoplastic fluids. In this work, the steady fractal vane-in-cup (fVIC) flow of a Newtonian fluid and a nonthixotropic Carbopol\u00ae 940 microgel as well as the unsteady flow of a thixotropic \u03ba-Carrageenan gel are analyzed using rheo-particle image velocimetry (Rheo-PIV). We describe the velocity distributions in all cases and show that the fVIC produces an almost axisymmetric flow field and rotation rate-independent \u201ceffective radius\u201d when used with both the Newtonian fluid and the microgel. These findings are supported by 2D simulation results and enable the safe use of both the Couette analogy and the torque-to-stress conversion scheme for a 24-arm fVIC as well as validate it as a reliable rheometrical tool for characterization of a variety of complex fluids. With the \u03ba-Carrageenan gel, however, axial shearing/compression while inserting the rheometric tool into the sample also accelerates syneresis that ultimately results in shear banding for Couette and fVIC flows. By comparing results obtained using the 24-arm fVIC with other conventional geometries, we investigate the effect that the lateral and cross-sectional (shearing/compressing) area of the measuring fixture have on disrupting the \u03ba-Carrageenan gel during its insertion."

    "In the past decade, cancer immunotherapy has been a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. However, immunotherapy has failed to improve responses in certain cancers such as ovarian cancer (OC). The action of cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is key to regulating immune responses, but dose-limiting toxicities limit the application of cytokines in cancer therapy. One promising approach to improve treatment with cytokines are nanoparticles (NPs) which, when modulated via layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly, can provide many of the desirable characteristics of cytokine-delivery vehicles including tumor cell targeting, subcellular localization, and improved pharmacokinetics. In this thesis, we address some aspects of NPs that have limited their clinical utility including manufacturing, control over self-assembly, and mechanistic understanding of their interactions in biological environments The focus here was on using liposomal LbL-NPs coated with a bilayer of poly-L-arginine (PLR) and poly-L-glutamate (PLE). The coating of NPs with PLR/PLE enables targeting towards cancer cell surfaces which allows for extended extracellular presentation of cargos. This ability is used for targeted delivery of a potent immunostimulant \u2013 interleukin-12 (IL-12) to disseminated tumors in metastatic OC. Aspects on the manufacturing of other lipid-based nanocarriers such as discoidal assemblies and immune stimulating complexes (ISCOMs) are also explored. We show that employing a bottom-up approach to produce lipid-based NPs from mixed micelles allows for greater control over NP self-assembly. With this procedure, we generated immune stimulating complexes (ISCOMs) co-loaded with monophosphoryl-lipid-A (MPLA) via a scalable approach for clinical-scale manufacturing of the adjuvant termed Saponin MPLA NanoParticles (SMNP). Moreover, we discover that this approach allows for precise control over liposome size from 50 nm to 1 \u00b5m with minimal polydispersity. Lastly, by exploiting the lipid headgroup charge repulsion, we find that multivalent charged lipids yield discoidal lipid nanoparticles through this approach. Unlike previous attempts to generate lipid-based discs, this new class of NPs termed charge-stabilized nanodiscs (CND) do not require disc-stabilizing agents such as proteins or polymers. CNDs are shown to be promising drug delivery vehicles, especially when coated with PLR/PLE via the LbL technique where they have greater tumor accumulation than LbL-coated liposomes. On the use of LbL-NP for cytokine delivery via PLR/PLE coated NPs, we found that covalent conjugation of IL-12 to the liposomal core of LbL-NPs greatly improves targeting and retention of IL-12 in peritoneally-disseminated OC tumors, enabling immunological and therapeutic effects not observed with free cytokine treatment. Mechanistic investigations revealed that these LbL-NPs rapidly accumulated in tumor nodules upon intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration, wherein shedding of the LbL coating allowed for gradual release of IL-12-lipid 3 conjugates via lipid extraction by serum proteins present in interstitial fluid. Upon a single dose of IL-12 conjugated to LbL-NPs using an intraperitoneally disseminated OV2944 highly-metastatic (HM-1) mouse model, we observed a dramatic increase in T cell levels within the ascites and the tumor nodules dispersed within the i.p. space which was not observed with either free cytokine or unlayered IL-12-NPs. When evaluated for its effectiveness in this highly aggressive model, two doses could significantly enhance survival compared to even five times (5x) the amount of free cytokine. Remarkably, while the model was non-responsive to checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy with anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4, when combined with LbL-IL-12-NPs, we achieved complete responses with robust immune memory induction. The mice were able to rapidly clear rechallenges with fresh cancer cells in the i.p. space. Towards the clinical translation of LbL-IL12-NPs, we demonstrate that LbL assembly is readily performed via microfluidic mixing technology amenable for clinical-scale manufacturing. We also find that we can titrate the polymer amount used to omit time-consuming purification steps. We also find that the LbL film conformation is key to maintaining therapeutic efficacy as thicker films hinder IL-12 delivery. Lastly, we uncover that the binding target of PLE on the surface of cancer cells is SLC1A5, a glutamine amino acid transporter."

    "Physical aging is a slow structural relaxation process characteristic of glassy polymers that results in reduced membrane permeabilities. In this study, PIM-1, the archetypal polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM), was post-synthetically modified to introduce components that are known to influence physical aging, such as hydrogen bonds and crosslinks. The effects of physical aging were monitored by permeation and sorption experiments, and structural changes were examined by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) and other characterization techniques. The results suggest that higher initial fractional free volume is the primary factor contributing to higher rates of physical aging and that the introduction of hydrogen bonds and crosslinks reduces the initial free volume of PIM-1. In contrast, structural factors such as hydrogen bonds and crosslinks were the key factors in determining how permselectivity changed with physical aging. This study provides useful structure\u2013property correlations and design principles related to free volume, hydrogen bonds, and crosslinks on physical aging behavior of microporous polymer membranes."

    "All aerobic organisms need a way to sense oxygen levels and respond accordingly when in an unfavorable environment. In almost all metazoans, oxygen is both sensed and regulated by the HIF-1 (hypoxia inducible factor) transcription factor that is activated in periods of hypoxia and goes on to regulate hundreds of genes allowing for appropriate adaptations to hypoxia. HIF-1 activation results in changes at the cellular, tissue and whole organism levels such as increases in glycolysis, vascularization and erythropoiesis; HIF-1 is a critical factor in human development as well as progression of numerous diseases including ischemic stroke, COPD and cancer. HIF-1 is negatively regulated by the O2-dependent prolyl hydroxylase EGL-9 (known as EGLN, PHD, or HIF-PH in mammals). In normoxic conditions, EGL-9 uses ambient O2 to hydroxylate HIF-1. Hydroxylated HIF-1 is recognized by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL-1) tumor suppressor protein, a component of an E3-ubiquitin ligase complex that targets HIF-1 for proteasomal degradation. In hypoxic conditions, EGL-9 is unable to hydroxylate HIF-1; stabilized HIF-1 enters the nucleus to regulate the expression of target genes that coordinate the hypoxia response. Increased activity of HIF-1, produced by either hypoxia or an egl-9(lf) mutation, induces the hypoxic stress response, which coordinates numerous adaptive changes in C. elegans, including retention of eggs in the uterus, decreases in locomotion and defecation rates, and increased resistance to not only hypoxia but also other stresses including oxidative stress and ER stress. By identifying suppressors of the egl-9(lf) mutant phenotype of egg retention, we have identified two independent pathways that regulate aspects of the hypoxic response in C. elegans. First, we discovered that loss of the conserved nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, an RNA surveillance mechanism that degrades aberrant mRNA transcripts with premature termination codons, suppressed the egl-9(lf)-induced changes in egg laying and defecation and caused increased hypoxia sensitivity. Other aspects of the egl-9(lf) phenotype, such as resistance to oxidative stress and changes in locomotion, were not affected by NMD-pathway mutations, indicating that NMD modulates specific aspects of the hypoxia response. Secondly, we found that loss of the neprilysin metallopeptidase, nep-2, suppressed the egl-9 Egl phenotype through the degradation of multiple neuropeptides including the known NEP-2 target SNET-1. Our findings reveal two different pathways that function downstream of egl-9 to regulate aspects of the hypoxic stress response, both providing a new pathway with which to study the neuromuscular control of egg laying using NEP-2, and critically showing the integration of the evolutionarily conserved hypoxic-stress response and nonsense-mediated decay pathways."

    "Switched capacitor converters are a category of power electronic converters that harness the significantly improved energy density of capacitors as opposed to that of their conventional, inductor-based counterparts to reap benefits in terms of efficiency, size, and utilization. This work presents the analysis, design, construction, and evaluation of one such converter, inspired by the flying capacitor multilevel topology and referred to as a condensed buck-boost converter. This converter is designed and built for an application as the interface between the battery voltage and DC bus on partially electrified aircraft, where the advantages of its ability to step up/down voltage in an efficient and lightweight fashion can be fully realized. In order to be implemented in hardware for the first time, this work utilize new monolithic, bidirectional GaN FETs, whose reverse voltage blocking capabilities open new possibilities for a converter design that wastes less power and occupies less board area. This converter is compared with others that perform similar functions to showcase the benefits that this topology has to offer."

    "Across modern civilization, societal norms and rules are codified and communicated largely in the form of written laws. Although principles of communicative efficiency and legal doctrine dictate that laws be comprehensible to the common world, legal documents have long been attested to be incomprehensible to those who are required to comply with them (i.e. everyone). Why? This thesis investigates this question using the tools of cognitive science. Chapter II approaches the question from the comprehender side, documenting the cognitive and linguistic factors that make legal documents difficult to understand for non-lawyers. Corpus analyses reveal that legal contracts are laden with psycholinguistically complex structures at a strikingly higher rate than nine baseline genres of English. Experimental evidence further reveals that some of these structures, such as center-embedded syntax, inhibit recall and comprehension of legal content more than others, suggesting that difficulties in understanding legal content result largely from working-memory limitations imposed by long-distance syntactic dependencies as opposed to a mere lack of specialized legal knowledge. Chapter III extends these results to other legal genres and investigates the cognitive and linguistic profile of law over time. Analyzing every law passed by congress between 1951 and 2022 with matched texts from four different genres, we find that laws have and continue to be disproportionately laden with psycholinguistically complex structures relative to baseline genres of English, suggesting that top-down efforts to simplify legal texts over this period have largely failed. 3 Chapters IV and V turn to the producer side, investigating why legal actors write in a complex manner in the first place. We find that lawyers likewise struggle to recall and comprehend legal content drafted in a complex register and prefer simplified legal documents to complex documents across virtually every dimension. We further find that people tasked with writing official laws write in a more convoluted manner than when tasked with writing unofficial legal texts of equivalent conceptual complexity, whereas people editing a legal document do not write in a more convoluted manner than when writing from scratch. From a cognitive perspective, these results suggest law to be a rare exception to the general tendency in human language towards communicative efficiency. In particular, these results indicate law\u2019s complexity to be derived from its performativity, whereby low-frequency structures may be inserted to signal law\u2019s authoritative, world-state-altering nature, at the cost of increased processing demands on readers. From a legal perspective, these findings call into question the coherence and legitimacy of legal theories and principles whose validity rests on the notion of law being comprehensible to laypeople, such as ordinary meaning, fair notice, and modern variants of textualism. From a policy perspective, this work informs long-standing efforts to simplify legal documents for the public at-large, which, despite bipartisan support, have remained largely intractable. Finally, from a field-building perspective, this thesis lays the foundation for a broader interdisciplinary research program that uses insights from cognitive science to inform long-standing and cutting-edge questions of legal doctrine and policy."

    "Numerical model simulations (Delft3D SWAN) are used to examine the impact of small alongshore variations in the bathymetry of an outer sandbar (in about 5-m water depth) on the nearshore wave field as the shallow (< 3 m) bathymetry changes from near alongshore uniform to strongly spatially variable to understand wave driven morphologic evolution. Waves were observed at Duck, NC with an array of 14 pressure gages between 1- and 3-m water depth spread over 250 meters alongshore. Bathymetry was measured between the dune toe and about 8-m water depth on September 26 and October 2, 2013. The bathymetry evolved from roughly alongshore uniform on September 26 to strongly alongshore variable on October 2. Between these dates incident significant wave heights ranged from 0.5 meters to 2.3 meters, with incident angles from 20 degrees north to 5 degrees south of shore normal. Simulations were run with observed bathymetry for both the outer bar and inner shallow bathymetry, with smoothed outer bar and observed shallow bathymetry, and with digital elevation model bathymetry to determine the effects of outer bar and shallow bathymetry on wave evolution."

    "In large, distributed computations with small amounts of work done at each node, networking latencies quickly add up, especially in comparison to the time taken to execute small tasks. As such, lowering network latencies is crucial to getting good performance. Previous research has shown that often the largest contributors to network latencies are data copies between kernel and application buffers. Conventional wisdom argues that to solve this problem, one should move the networking stack out of the kernel and into the user space or networking hardware. Instead, we build upon an alternative approach, known as LakePlacid. LakePlacid mitigates the kernel-user boundary overhead issue by moving the most important application logic out of the user space and into the kernel. This thesis proposes and implements a key improvement to LakePlacid. Because only part of the application logic is migrated to the kernel, some packets necessarily must be resolved in the standard user space application. The system discussed in this thesis allows packets which cannot be handled in the kernel to seamlessly continue in user space via on-stack replacement, thus preventing side effects from being executed erroneously. This system for on-stack replacement is very general, allowing execution to switch between code versions at any conditional, and it is novel in its ability to switch stacks across the user-kernel boundary. With this change, LakePlacid is able to better maintain the semantics of user applications, making it more feasible in practice."

    "This study aimed to identify when and how eye movements change across the human lifespan to benchmark developmental biomarkers. The sample size comprised 45,696 participants, ranging in age from 6 to 80 years old (M = 30.39; SD = 17.46). Participants completed six eye movement tests: Circular Smooth Pursuit, Horizontal Smooth Pursuit, Vertical Smooth Pursuit, Horizontal Saccades, Vertical Saccades, and Fixation Stability. These tests examined all four major eye movements (fixations, saccades, pursuits, and vergence) using 89 eye-tracking algorithms. A semi-supervised, self-training, machine learning classifier was used to group the data into age ranges. This classifier resulted in 12 age groups: 6\u20137, 8\u201311, 12\u201314, 15\u201325, 26\u201331, 32\u201338, 39\u201345, 46\u201353, 54\u201360, 61\u201368, 69\u201376, and 77\u201380 years. To provide a descriptive indication of the strength of the self-training classifier, a series of multiple analyses of variance (MANOVA) were conducted on the multivariate effect of the age groups by test set. Each MANOVA revealed a significant multivariate effect on age groups (p &lt; 0.001). Developmental changes in eye movements across age categories were identified. Specifically, similarities were observed between very young and elderly individuals. Middle-aged individuals (30s) generally showed the best eye movement metrics. Clinicians and researchers may use the findings from this study to inform decision-making on patients\u2019 health and wellness and guide effective research methodologies."

    "This study conducts a comprehensive technoeconomic analysis of geothermal district heating (GDH) in the Boston, MA area, with a specific focus on the MIT campus. The research begins by reviewing the evolution of district energy systems, highlighting various use cases, technologies, and policy developments. It then defines the system problem and establishes a framework for implementing a geothermal district heating system at MIT. The analysis examines the economic viability and decarbonization potential of the GDH system, identifying various system architectures and phased campus sector implementation scenarios. These scenarios are compared to a 'business as usual' reference case. The study reveals that the recommended implementation scenario, MG-E-N-W, not only offers the lowest cost but also achieves the lowest emissions. Over a 30-year period, this scenario presents a net present value (NPV) savings of more than $700 million and 2 million MTCO2e compared to the reference case, making it the most economically and environmentally favorable option for MIT's campus energy system transformation."

    "High performance computing libraries provide efficient implementations of common computational kernels. Traditionally, such libraries are written in C or assembly. User-schedulable languages provide performance engineers a productive way to optimize these kernels with welldesigned interfaces which provide users control over performance-relevant decisions and automate unnecessary concerns. Often, this is a tradeoff: too much control with too little automation is tedious to program, and too much automation with too little control will hinder obtaining peak performance. The principle of exocompilation advocates for one end of the extreme: to give performance engineers maximal control over code execution so they can maximize performance, its current implementation in existing systems is impractical to use. This thesis broadly explores ways to make exocompilation a practical solution for performance engineers. We show that providing more control does not necessitate sacrificing automation, as long as the language is designed so that users can build their own automation. We explore the necessary design features to enable such a system, demonstrate the types of automation users can build in the system, and brainstorm ways to further push the amount of control user-schedule languages expose to the user."

    "The brain is in continuous communication with the rest of the body. Nerves connect the peripheral and central nervous system, and complex vasculature networks selectively permit passage of small molecules with an exogenous origin into the brain parenchyma. Although brain-body interactions underpin a host of cognitive and physiological phenomena, they are often overlooked in studies of brain biology and mental function. We studied aspects of the interaction between brain and body using functional and molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in combination with other tools. In a first project, we examined properties of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is a highly selective collection of endothelial cells and tight junction proteins that restrict passage of extracerebral substances from the blood vessels into the brain tissue. We disrupted and bypassed the BBB to deliver an MRI contrast agent and quantitatively assessed the resulting contrast dynamics. We discovered that individual brain regions display method-independent susceptibility to BBB disruption and washout, suggesting principles for calibrating drug delivery and understanding the propensity for chemical exchange across the BBB. We then used one of the widefield brain delivery techniques to apply a novel contrast agent for the study of the cholinergic system, a neurochemical pathway important for motor control mechanisms in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Kinetic modeling of probe distributions revealed intrinsic localization of cholinergic enzymes. Finally, we applied related neuroimaging tools to an animal model of substance abuse, a pathology for which brain-body interactions are particularly engaged but underappreciated. We designed a study to investigate the role of the insula, a cortical mediator of peripheral physiological signals, in responses to opioid exposure. With molecular imaging approaches, we show the insula shapes drug-dependent brain phenotypes and physiological responses during substance exposure and withdrawal. In all, this work serves as a demonstration of the power of quantitative neuroimaging methods for multifaceted investigation of brain and body relationships."

    "Forecasts of technological progress are used to inform decisions in the public and private sectors that shape the modern technology landscape on a global scale. Technology performance curves are the quantitative, model-based representations of technological change employed in industrial, economic, and integrated assessment models to inform decision-making processes. Technology performance curves have evolved from their origins in the 1920s modeling of airframe manufacturing labor cost to consider mechanisms of technological progress, including learning-by-doing, learning-by-searching, economies of scale, and exogenous improvement. Examining changes to the performance and prevalence of technologies can provide insight that is relevant for product strategy and market forecasts. This knowledge can also help estimate the potential impact of government market policy and funding for research and development. This thesis seeks to consolidate the available literature on the various models of technology performance curves into a conceptual framework that can be used to understand the features and limitations of models, and their potential use cases."

    "A persistent challenge plaguing lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is the consumption of active lithium with the formation of SEI. This leads to an irreversible lithium loss in the initial cycle and a gradual further exhaustion of active lithium in subsequent cycles. While prelithiation has been proven effective in compensating for this loss by introducing additional active lithium into batteries, prior studies have predominantly concentrated on offsetting the initial lithium loss, often overlooking the continuous lithium consumption that occurs throughout cycling. To address this challenge, we employed a sustained in situ lithium replenishment strategy that involves the systematic release of additional lithium inventory through precise capacity control during long-term cycling. Our method utilizes a lithium replenishment separator (LRS) coated with dilithium squarate-carbon nanotube (Li2C4O4\u2013CNT) as the lithium compensation reagent. Placing Li2C4O4 on the separator rather than within the cathode significantly reduces disruptions in conduction pathways and inhibits catalytic reactions with LiFePO4, preventing the formation of carbon residues. When implemented in the LiFePO4||graphite battery system, our approach resulted in an impressive 12.9% capacity improvement in the initial cycle and a remarkable 97.2% capacity retention over 700 cycles, surpassing the comparison group, which exhibited 80% capacity retention after 426 cycles."

    "Coastal vegetation can provide protection to the coastline through its root structures, which reduce soil erosion, and its stem structures, which dissipate wave energy. The drag a plant induces could be used to quantify the amount of coastal protection that is provided. This study combined field measurements and drone surveys to develop methods for quantifying vegetation drag, focusing on Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora), a smooth cordgrass native to the study site: Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. The drag of a single plant is proportional to frontal area. The drag per bed area is proportional to the drag of a single plant and the number of stems per bed area. This study collected plant samples over the growing season to generate allometric relationships between tiller height and individual plant biomass and frontal area, which provides a way to translate remotely-sensed measures of biomass into stem count and frontal area per bed area. The frontal area was measured through digital imaging of individual plants. The elastic modulus of the stem was also measured using an Instron testing machine. For sixteen 1m x 1m test plots, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) extracted from drone multispectral imagery was compared to measured stem count and estimated biomass. The study compared two different years and three time points within a growing season [August 2022; June, August, October 2023]. In addition, at three plots the stem count was manually altered by cutting out 50% and 100% of the plants. This study found that while NDVI can be used to determine the abundance of S. alterniflora, there are several limitations that cause the correlations to be case-specific. Limitations to NDVI-S. alterniflora correlations included: (1) saturation, (2) species inhomogeneity of the area tested, (3) shoot density inhomogeneity of the area tested, and (4) environmental conditions."

    "While race detection algorithms like SP-bags have provably good theoretical properties, large overheads exist in practice, which urges the need for performance optimization. In this thesis, I propose labeling schemes as a method of circumventing many of the expensive operations in Cilksan, an implementation of the SP-bags algorithm. The proposed labeling schemes give strands of a parallel program labels during the execution of Cilksan, allowing Cilksan to shortcut the processing of certain memory accesses if the label comparison allows. I describe and prove correctness for two labeling schemes, the procedure labeling scheme and the prefix labeling scheme, implement both in Cilksan, and measure their performance. While the results show that the overhead of maintaining labels is too high in my implementation, the labeling schemes manage to circumvent many of the memory access operations, suggesting the merit of a more performant implementation of the same schemes."

    "An asymptotic study is made of nonlinear effects in steady radiating waves due to moving sources in dispersive media. The focus is on problems where the radiated waves have exponentially small amplitude with respect to a parameter \u03bc << 1, as for instance free-surface waves due to a submerged body in the limit of low Froude number. In such settings, weakly nonlinear effects (controlled by the source strength \u03b5) can be as important as linear propagation effects (controlled by \u03bc), and computing the wave response for \u03bc, \u03b5 << 1may require exponential (beyond-all-orders) asymptotics. This issue is discussed here using a simple model, namely, the forced Korteweg\u2013de Vries (fKdV) equation where \u03bc is the dispersion and \u03b5 is the nonlinearity parameter. The forcing term f(x) is assumed to be even and its Fourier transform \u02c6 f(k) to decay for k >> 1 like Ak\u03b1 exp(\u2212\u03b2k), where A, \u03b1 and \u03b2 > 0 are free parameters. For this class of forcing profiles, the wave response hinges on beyond-all-orders asymptotics only if \u03b1 > \u22121, and nonlinear effects differ fundamentally depending on whether \u03b1 > 0, \u03b1 = 0 or \u22121 < \u03b1 < 0. Furthermore, the sign of the forcing amplitude parameter A is an important controlling factor of the nonlinear wave response. The asymptotic results compare favorably against direct numerical solutions of the fKdV equation for a wide range of \u03bc and \u03b5, in contrast to the linear wave response whose validity is rather limited."

    "We study the problem of constructing explicit sparse graphs that exhibit strong vertex expansion. Our main result is the first two-sided construction of imbalanced unique-neighbor expanders, meaning bipartite graphs where small sets contained in both the left and right bipartitions exhibit unique-neighbor expansion, along with algebraic properties relevant to constructing quantum codes.\r\nOur constructions are obtained from instantiations of the tripartite line product of a large tripartite spectral expander and a sufficiently good constant-sized unique-neighbor expander, a new graph product we defined that generalizes the line product and the routed product of previous well-known works. To analyze the vertex expansion of graphs arising from the tripartite line product, we develop a sharp characterization of subgraphs that can arise in bipartite spectral expanders, generalizing previously known results, which may be of independent interest.\r\nBy picking appropriate graphs to apply our product to, we give a strongly explicit construction of an infinite family of (d1,d2)-biregular graphs (Gn)n\u2265 1 (for large enough d1 and d2) where all sets S with fewer than a small constant fraction of vertices have \u03a9(d1\u00b7 |S|) unique-neighbors (assuming d1 \u2264 d2).

    "The key assumption underlying linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is that the learner has access to a known feature map \u03c6(x, a) that maps state-action pairs to d-dimensional vectors, and that the rewards and transition probabilities are linear functions in this representation. But where do these features come from? In the absence of expert domain knowledge, a tempting strategy is to use the \u201ckitchen sink\u201d approach and hope that the true features are included in a much larger set of potential features. In this paper we revisit linear MDPs from the perspective of feature selection. In a k-sparse linear MDP, there is an unknown subset S \u2282 [d] of size k containing all the relevant features, and the goal is to learn a near-optimal policy in only poly(k,logd) interactions with the environment. Our main result is the first polynomial-time algorithm for this problem. In contrast, earlier works either made prohibitively strong assumptions that obviated the need for exploration, or required solving computationally intractable optimization problems. Along the way we introduce the notion of an emulator: a succinct approximate representation of the transitions, that still suffices for computing certain Bellman backups. Since linear MDPs are a non-parametric model, it is not even obvious whether polynomial-sized emulators exist. We show that they do exist, and moreover can be computed efficiently via convex programming. As a corollary of our main result, we give an algorithm for learning a near-optimal policy in block MDPs whose decoding function is a low-depth decision tree; the algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time and takes a polynomial number of samples (in the size of the decision tree). This can be seen as a reinforcement learning analogue of classic results in computational learning theory. Furthermore, it gives a"

    "Systems thinking is crucial for understanding and solving complex problems and is considered an important thinking skill in engineering. Active learning is considered an effective approach for fostering STEM students\u2019 systems thinking. However, viable methods for teaching and assessing systems thinking with active learning across STEM disciplines, particularly in first-year undergraduate education, are still under-researched. In this paper, we introduce a research-based framework named System Architecture-Function-Outcome to help first-year STEM instructors both foster and assess students\u2019 introductory systems thinking. To conduct an initial evaluation of the framework\u2019s suitability in active learning settings, we designed a directed case-based learning assignment with an adapted article and a rubric for assessing \u2018introductory systems thinking\u2019, as defined in the framework. We deployed the assignment among 84 first-year STEM students and successfully tested its inter-rater reliability, with 75\u2013100% inter-rater agreement across all assessment criteria. We discuss the implications of our results on fostering and assessing first-year STEM students\u2019 systems thinking, and outline examples for potential applications of the framework, pending further validation, in case-based learning settings of varying degrees of learner autonomy, from lecture-based to problem-based learning."

    "The recent increased interest in microreactor designs has presented the opportunity to take advantage of the smaller core dimensions to perform steady state neutronic-thermal coupled simulation with the inclusion of an additional physics system. This work accomplishes this, by adding thermal expansion and zirconium hydride-based hydrogen diffusion to the neutronic-thermal simulation of multiple heat pipe microreactor designs. Microreactors\u2019 smaller cores are inherently characterized by more leakage than gigawatt-scale reactor cores. The inclusion of thermal expansion\u2019s representation in the coupling system may reveal neutronic or thermal impacts of geometric expansion that have yet to be noted for these smaller scale geometries. This is the impetus for the work on thermal expansion. The work on hydrogen diffusion is inspired by the common use of zirconium hydride in microreactor designs as a moderator. This material provides high density of hydrogen with high melting point, but features a well documented increase in mobility of hydrogen within the zirconium lattice at high temperatures. Coupling this migration of hydrogen within the neutronic-thermal simulation is performed in order to identify and analyze neutronic and thermal impacts due to the movement of hydrogen within the moderator. Additionally, a heat pipe failure case is simulated for each microreactor geometry studied, aimed to analyze the impacts of multipipe failure on both thermal expansion and hydrogen diffusion, as well as their downstream neutronic-thermal effects."

    "The past decade has seen a surge of interest in psychedelic compounds as therapeutic medicine. Ibogaine, an indole alkaloid extracted exclusively from an endangered family of shrubs from Central African nations of Gabon and Cameroon, is a psychedelic currently being studied for its unique therapeutic potential. It is also considered the most extreme of the psychedelic drugs currently known to researchers. For the past fifty years, it\u2019s been used to treat severe substance use disorders, particularly with highly addictive opioids and stimulants. In the past ten years, American special operations forces veterans have begun to take ibogaine to treat traumatic brain injuries (TBI). Anecdotal evidence has suggested that the permanent, downstream symptoms TBI patients experience after these injuries are effectively managed after a single ibogaine treatment. Advocacy from the special operations veterans community prompted Stanford University researchers to embark on the first-ever U.S.-based clinical trial of ibogaine to treat TBI. The study, published in January, 2024, further evidenced decades of evidence of ibogaine\u2019s clinical use potential. Yet questions still remain about whether or not ibogaine\u2019s cardiac toxicity can effectively be managed in human patients, as well as the true therapeutic utility of the prolonged period of dreamlike consciousness ibogaine produces in patients. This thesis examines the cases of three patients\u2013all United States military veterans\u2013undergoing ibogaine therapy, examining how the biological impacts of ibogaine, as well as their psychedelic experiences, may have saved their lives."

    "Nano-composites formed by mixing nanoparticles and polymers offer a limitless creative space for the design of functional advanced materials with a broad range of applications in materials and biological sciences. Here we focus on aqueous dispersions of hydrophobic colloidal soot particles, namely carbon black (CB) dispersed with a sodium salt of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a food additive known as cellulose gum that bears hydrophobic groups, which are liable to bind physically to CB particles. Varying the relative content of CB nanoparticles and cellulose gum allows us to explore a rich phase diagram that includes a gel phase observed for large enough CB content. We investigate this hydrogel using rheometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. CB-CMC hydrogels display two radically different types of mechanical behaviors that are separated by a critical CMC-to-CB mass ratio \ufffd\ufffd. For \ufffd<\ufffd\ufffd, i.e., for low CMC concentration, the gel is electrically conductive and shows a glassy-like viscoelastic spectrum, pointing to a microstructure composed of a percolated network of CB nanoparticles decorated by CMC. In contrast, gels with CMC concentration larger than \ufffd\ufffd are non-conductive, indicating that the CB nanoparticles are dispersed in the cellulose gum matrix as isolated clusters, and act as physical crosslinkers of the CMC network, hence providing mechanical rigidity to the composite. Moreover, in the concentration range, \ufffd>\ufffd\ufffd CB-CMC gels display a power-law viscoelastic spectrum that depends strongly on the CMC concentration. These relaxation spectra can be rescaled onto a master curve that exhibits a power-law scaling in the high-frequency limit, with an exponent that follows Zimm theory, showing that CMC plays a key role in the gel viscoelastic properties for \ufffd>\ufffd\ufffd. Our results offer an extensive experimental characterization of CB-CMC dispersions that will be useful for designing soft nano-composites based on hydrophobic interactions."

    "A d-dimensional simplicial complex X is said to support a direct product tester if any locally consistent function defined on its k-faces (where k\u226a d) necessarily come from a function over its vertices. More precisely, a direct product tester has a distribution \u00b5 over pairs of k-faces (A,A\u2032), and given query access to F: X(k)\u2192{0,1}k it samples (A,A\u2032)\u223c \u00b5 and checks that F[A]|A\u2229 A\u2032 = F[A\u2032]|A\u2229 A\u2032. The tester should have (1) the \u201dcompleteness property\u201d, meaning that any assignment F which is a direct product assignment passes the test with probability 1, and (2) the \u201dsoundness property\u201d, meaning that if F passes the test with probability s, then F must be correlated with a direct product function. Dinur and Kaufman showed that a sufficiently good spectral expanding complex X admits a direct product tester in the \u201dhigh soundness\u201d regime where s is close to 1. They asked whether there are high dimensional expanders that support direct product tests in the \u201dlow soundness\u201d, when s is close to 0. We give a characterization of high-dimensional expanders that support a direct product tester in the low soundness regime. We show that spectral expansion is insufficient, and the complex must additionally satisfy a variant of coboundary expansion, which we refer to as \u201dUnique-Games coboundary expanders\u201d. Conversely, we show that this property is also sufficient to get direct product testers. This property can be seen as a high-dimensional generalization of the standard notion of coboundary expansion over non-Abelian groups for 2-dimensional complexes. It asserts that any locally consistent Unique-Games instance obtained using the low-level faces of the complex, must admit a good global solution."

    "The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI\u2019s GPT series into diverse sectors has significantly enhanced digital interactions but also introduced new security challenges, notably the risk of \"jailbreaking\" where inputs cause models to deviate from their operational guidelines. This vulnerability poses risks such as misinformation spread and privacy breaches, highlighting the need for robust security measures. Traditional red-teaming methods, involving manually crafted prompts to test model vulnerabilities, are labor-intensive and lack scalability. This thesis proposes a novel automated approach using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to transform unsuccessful adversarial prompts into a successful jailbreak. Thus it learns a policy based on relation to existing jailbreak prompts that informs the generator LLM of what makes an adversarial prompt successful. This was implemented using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and tested with both a classifier and judge reward model, attaining at best a 16% attach success rate on a target model. This research can be applied to any prompt at the word level and further analyzed on characteristics of toxicity. This work contributes to advancing LLM security measures, ensuring their safer deployment across various applications."

    "The growing interest in regenerative medicine has opened new avenues for novel cell therapies using stem cells. Bone marrow aspirate (BMA) is an important source of stromal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Conventional MSC harvesting from BMA relies on archaic centrifugation methods, often leading to poor yield due to osmotic stress, high centrifugation force, convoluted workflow, and long experimental time (\u223c2\u20133 hours). To address these issues, we have developed a scalable microfluidic technology based on deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) for MSC isolation. This passive, label-free cell sorting method capitalizes on the morphological differences between MSCs and blood cells (platelets and RBCs) for effective separation using an inverted L-shaped pillar array. To improve throughput, we developed a novel multi-chip DLD system that can process 2.5 mL of raw BMA in 20 \u00b1 5 minutes, achieving a 2-fold increase in MSC recovery compared to centrifugation methods. Taken together, we envision that the developed DLD platform will enable fast and efficient isolation of MSCs from BMA for effective downstream cell therapy in clinical settings."

    "Outside of controlled laboratory environments, cells are continually sensing and adapting to highly variable environmental conditions in an effort to maintain cellular homeostasis and to maximize fitness in each condition. Although specific stresses elicit distinct cellular responses, the reshaping of the proteome is a central element in most cellular adaptation. This dynamic proteome remodeling involves a highly orchestrated combination of regulated proteins synthesis, degradation, and modification, each contributing to the overall goal of matching the capacity of the expressed proteome to the demands of the sensed environment. Although each pathway will contribute, ultimately, whether cells mount a response primarily driven by synthesis or by degradation hinges on the nature and duration of the stress, as well as the cell type involved. Understanding the balance of these contributions has historically been challenging. As such, there is a need for approaches that can quantitatively resolve the contributions of protein synthesis and protein degradation pathways in a wide array of cellular and environmental contexts.\r\nQuantitative proteomics via mass spectrometry stands out as a powerful tool for deciphering these questions, as it allows one to simultaneously monitor thousands of proteins. In this work, I leverage the power of quantitative proteomics coupled with metabolic labeling to investigate how microbes remodel their proteome during cellular adaptation. In chapter 2, I describe the development and characterization of these proteomic methods, including a detailed analysis of the variety of metabolic labeling schemes that can be employed in budding yeasts, which facilitate the bulk of my thesis work. In chapters 3 and 4, I apply these methods to the methylotrophic yeast, Komagataella phaffii, which grows robustly on a diverse set of carbon sources. As such, I use K. phaffii as a key case study to explore questions of cellular adaptation. I find that the K. phaffii expressed proteome varies greatly between cells grown in methanol, oleate, or glucose and, interestingly, that proteome remodeling strategies vary in a context-dependent manner. Specifically, I find that autophagic degradation drives proteome remodeling under nitrogen starvation conditions, with selective autophagic degradation of peroxisome supporting the cells transition from methanol media to glucose media. In contrast, I uncover that synthesis and growth-coupled dilution is the primary driver as K. phaffii adapts from methanol media to oleate media. Given the deep proteome coverage enabled by my methods, and my application of these methods in a wide variety of genetic backgrounds (6) and environmental conditions (5), these datasets also serve as a rich resource to identify conditions stimulating degradation of specific proteins, as well as the genetically defined pathways supporting these activities. Finally, in appendices 1 and 2, I highlight how these approaches can be applied across different microbial species to broadly characterize the proteomic consequences of nutrient and genetic perturbations. Overall, my work highlights how the development and application of powerful quantitative methods provide a global view of how proteome remodeling supports cellular adaptation, reveal deeper insights into pathways supporting turnover of specific proteins, and help to identify potential therapeutic targets to ameliorate protein-turnover related diseases."

    "The current paradigm of polymer flow assumes that (i) the effect of the molecular weight of the macromolecules, M, and of the temperature, T, on the expression of the viscosity of polymer melts separate; (ii) the molecular weight for entanglement, Mc, is independent of T; and (iii) the determination of Mc by the break in the log viscosity curve against log M unequivocally differentiates un-entangled melts from entangled melts. We use reliable rheological data on monodispersed polystyrene samples from very low molecular weight (M/Mc = 0.015) to relatively high molecular weight (M/Mc = 34) to test the separation of M and T in the expression of the viscosity; we reveal that an overall illusion of the validity of the separation of T and M is mathematically comprehensible, especially at high temperature and for M &gt; 2Mc, but that, strictly speaking, the separation of M and T is not valid, except for certain periodic values of M equal to Mc, 2Mc, 4Mc, 8Mc, 16Mc, etc. (period doubling) organized around a \u201cpole reference\u201d value MR = 4Mc. We also reveal, for M &lt; Mc, the existence of a lower molecular weight limit, M\u2019c = Mc/8 for the onset of the macromolecular behavior (macro-coil). The discrete and periodic values of M that validate the separation of the effect of M and T on the viscosity generate the fragmentation of the molecular range into three rheological ranges. Likewise, we show that the effect of temperature is also fragmented into three rheological ranges for T &gt; Tg: Tg &lt; T&lt; (Tg + 23\u00b0), (Tg + 23\u00b0) &lt; T &lt; TLL and T &gt; TLL\u2019 where TLL is the liquid-liquid temperature. Our conclusion is that the classical formulation of the viscosity of polymer melts is so overly simplified that it is missing important experimental facts, such as period doubling for the separation of T and M, TLL, M\u2019c, and Mc, resulting in its inability to understand the true nature of entanglements. We present in the discussion of the paper the alternative approach to the viscoelastic behavior, \u201cthe duality and cross-duality\u201d of the Dual-conformers, showing how this model formalism was used to test mathematically and invalidate the separation of T and M in the classical formulation of viscosity."

    "The reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, play critical roles across diverse marine ecosystems, influencing redox chemistry and organismal health. The distribution and concentration of these compounds in the oceans may serve as important controls for various biogeochemical cycles. The contrasting physiological nature of ROS, serving as both integral compounds for cellular processes such as signaling and growth while inducing oxidative cell damage at elevated concentrations, has made interpretation of their roles in organismal and ecosystem health challenging. Despite the potential for these ROS to provide unique insights into the intricate interactions occurring at the interface between life and its surrounding environment, critical gaps in our understanding of these compounds in marine systems exist. In this thesis I explored two aspects of marine ROS. The first part is focused on advancing our understanding of the distribution of superoxide in the sea. As part of a multidisciplinary team, I developed a submersible chemiluminescent sensor (SOLARIS) capable of measuring ROS in situ to ocean depths greater than 4,000 meters. With the use of SOLARIS, I discovered that a broad diversity of sponges and corals are local hotspots of superoxide at depth. Then, I studied the distribution of superoxide in the stratified water column of the Baltic Sea and found large subsurface maxima in the aphotic zone. In the second part of this thesis, I probed the use of hydrogen peroxide as a monitoring agent of organismal health. I measured hydrogen peroxide and bromoform production by two seaweed species exposed to different stressors. An analysis of these signals suggests that hydrogen peroxide could serve as a non-invasive chemical signature for stress in seaweed meadows and farms. Lastly, I characterized hydrogen peroxide associated with different coral species during a Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease transmission experiment. I determined that hydrogen peroxide does not predict infection before lesions are visible, thus hindering its utility as an early-stage signature of disease within corals. Altogether, this thesis extends our perspective on the distribution and controls on ROS in various marine systems and provides a baseline for using ROS dynamics to monitor organismal health."

    "A symmetric tensor category arises by axiomatizing the basic properties of a representation category of a finite group A famous theorem of Deligne states that, in characteristic p = 0, any symmetric tensor category of moderate growth is essentially a representation category of an affine supergroup scheme. This is not true in positive characteristic, with the most fundamental counterexamples being the Verlinde category Ver\u209a and its higher analogs Ver\u209an. It seems these categories will play a role in generalizing Deligne's theorem, and therefore, to understand symmetric tensor categories of moderate growth in general, it is important to study affine group schemes in these categories. The first part of the thesis reviews this theory.\r\n\r\nIn the remainder of the thesis, we approach the study of Ver\u209a by considering two perspectives: the first perspective is that because these categories do not fiber over the category of supervector spaces, these categories provide examples of new phenomena which do not arise out of (super)algebra or (super)geometry. In particular, we explain how the Verlinde category can be used to provide new constructions of Lie superalgebras, and in particular exceptional simple Lie superalgebras in low characteristic. We also show that in characteristic 5 a new algebraic structure we call a \"weak Jordan algebra\" arises. Finally, we classify bilinear forms in the Verlinde category Ver\u2084\u207a and discuss the associated Witt semi-ring, which is a new algebraic structure.\r\n\r\nThe second perspective is that these categories actually contain the category of supervector spaces, so they must generalize what is already known. We extend the theory of Frobenius kernels to the Verlinde category and use it to prove an analog of the Steinberg tensor product theorem for the group scheme GL(X)."

    "As engineers continue to develop more sophisticated algorithms to optimize cryptographic algorithms, their often simple mathematical specifications become convoluted in the algorithms, from which a class of correctness bugs arise. Because cryptographic algorithms often secure sensitive information, their correctness, and in turn their security is a top priority. The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is an algorithm that enables efficient polynomial multiplication and has recently gained importance in post-quantum cryptography. This thesis presents a proof of correctness of the NTT in F\u22c6 , a proof-oriented programming language that extracts to OCaml, and shows that we can use the NTT to perform polynomial multiplications. We provide an implementation of the Cooley-Tukey fast NTT algorithm and a proof that it matches the original NTT specification. This thesis also presents a representation of polynomials in the F\u22c6 subset Low*, which extracts to performant C code."

    "\u201cInternet celebrity space\u201d offers a fresh perspective for studying urban spaces in the mobile Internet era as a new visual consumption space. The term \"Internet celebrity,\" or wanghong in Chinese, is utilized in modern Chinese media to refer to celebrities and the specific cultural and consumption trends linked to them. This concept has surfaced alongside the growth of e-commerce platforms, with the recognition that wanghong often engages in promoting products, services, or lifestyles to their followers. The internet celebrity spaces, or wanghong spaces, can elevate the popularity of certain areas and influence local neighborhoods, communities, and economies. Internet celebrity urbanism involves broadening this trend from certain locations to greater scales, encompassing entire districts or extending this status through urban scale. This thesis explores the impact of internet celebrity spaces in China. It is divided into three parts: Firstly, it demonstrates the phenomenon and background: study investigates the way Internet Celebrity spaces are represented in social media. Then, the studies focus on exploring the latest research and analyzing the research perspectives and methods to anchor the author\u2019s research questions with appropriate approaches. Lastly, the influence of Internet Celebrity spaces is discussed through examining the case in Shanghai by observing internet celebrity spaces\u2019 influence on street activity. With the analysis and conclusion, suggestions for future development are given."

    "Lithium ion batteries (LiBs) are a pivotal energy storage technology that are widely adopted for their high energy density and safety. From a macroscopic level, LiBs operate at a micrometer lengthscale, but consist of many active material nanoparticles which participate in reversible electrochemical reactions that store and release energy. These particles control the crucial processes for energy storage in macroscopic devices, generating a process spanning multiple length and time scales in LiBs. However, despite the ubiquitous application of LiBs in many industries, degradation limits their lifespan, hindering their broader applicability in usages demanding high energy density and extended lifespans, such as electric vehicles (EVs). Dominant degradation occurs at the nanoparticle level involving various mechanisms, such as formation of resistive films on the particle surface or surface phase transformations in common LiB materials. The effects of degradation are observed at the macroscopic level from electrochemical responses such as voltage or current measurements. Bridging the gap between microscopic and macroscopic scales to extract particle level degradation mechanisms from electrode scale responses is essential for understanding LiB degradation. These methods can be used to quantify degradation in battery materials for second life use, designing degradation resistant materials, and more.\r\n\r\nHere, I propose a comprehensive multiscale framework that initially models LiB degradation at a single particle scale, using nickel rich materials as an example, then projects single particle degradation into population scale for both solid solution and phase separating materials. Furthermore, I analyze and design improved pulse diagnostics using hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) methods to extract physical microscopic degradation mechanisms from electrode-level responses. Overall, I set up a consistent framework modeling degradation from single particle to population level and vice versa in LiBs."

    "Turbulence transport poses a significant challenge in fusion research. The measurement of turbulent fluctuations is critical for comprehending turbulence transport, predicting its behavior, and ultimately controlling it to maximize fusion gain. However, there is a notable scarcity electron temperature fluctuation diagnostics, including for high density tokamak plasmas and in spherical tokamaks. The ultimate aim of our research is to develop a novel diagnostic tool for temperature fluctuations. Before experimental exploration, conducting a numerical feasibility study is essential for the proposed diagnostic. The high spatial and temporal resolutions that are attainable using Soft X-ray (SXR) imaging makes it a promising candidate. The primary objective of the thesis is to assess the feasibility of an electron temperature fluctuation diagnostic based on SXR imaging.\r\n\r\nThe feasibility study involves gathering fluctuation data and constructing a numerical diagnostic model. This model computes synthetic SXR measurements, which are then reconstructed using tomographic algorithms to derive electron temperature fluctuations. These reconstructions are then compared against the ground truth to assess diagnostic performance. Optimization of performance is achieved by adjusting diagnostic parameters to identify the optimal set for feasibility analysis.\r\n\r\nThis study consists of two primary parts. First, we utilize a simplified toy model with circular plasma geometry and synthetic fluctuation data abstracted from gyrokinetic simulation fluctuation spectra and we employ a pseudolocal tomography algorithm for reconstruction and demonstrate reliable measurement of electron temperature fluctuations for X-ray detectors with sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio. Second, we conduct a more comprehensive feasibility study using fluctuation data directly generated from gyrokinetic simulations, in a real (spherical tokamak) NSTX-U configuration with complex plasma geometry. Assumptions from the previous study, such as infinitely thin beam size, are relaxed to assess their impact on reconstruction. Additionally, we enhance the reconstruction algorithm using neural networks, enabling reconstruction of both electron density and temperature fluctuations, as well as cross-phase analysis. Overall, the study confirms the feasibility of the SXR diagnostic given that SXR detectors meet minimum requirements. Furthermore, we explore fluctuations generated from different gyrokinetic simulations, demonstrating the diagnostic's ability to differentiate fluctuations originating from different instabilities under the same configuration.\r\n\r\nThis research provides a theoretical foundation and guidance for developing a practical SXR-based electron temperature fluctuation diagnostic for experimental use. It outlines the measurable quantities, their limitations, and the minimum requirements for SXR hardware to ensure reliable measurements. This contribution significantly advances our understanding of plasma turbulence transport, addressing a key challenge in fusion research. However, the current study's limitations employ a simplified emissivity model. Utilizing a more comprehensive model incorporating atomic data could yield more robust conclusions. Additionally, incorporating real hardware parameters would enhance the reliability of the conclusion."

    "Yale art history professor George Kubler\u2019s seminal 1962 publication The Shape of Time is, according to his own words, representative of a \u201ccrossroads between the history and anthropology of art.\u201d This work does not stand alone, but is rather part of a larger corpus of study through which Kubler recurred to disciplines, methods and tools outside of what is traditionally considered art historical\u2014including anthropology, architectural representation, and biology\u2014in order to generate new readings and understandings of the history of South and Central American art. This thesis takes a look into a year of Kubler\u2019s life in 1948-49, spent in Peru conducting archival research and field work on culture change with the Institute for Social Anthropology at the Smithsonian Institution and teaching a seminar on the use of archival sources in ethnology at Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos in Lima; during this time, Kubler also engaged in the construction of an archive of his own. Drawing from correspondence and other records from the period in question, a series of lost episodes resurface, providing a reconstruction of various strata of 1940s Peruvian society: an increasingly cosmopolitan Lima stands in stark contrast to the underdeveloped, feudal Andean world, evidencing its colonial underpinnings. I contend that witnessing the coexistence of various temporalities within a single geographic territory had a significant impact on Kubler\u2019s later theories on spatialized historical time."

    "Omnidirectional wheels enable robots to achieve holonomic motion; however, this often comes at the cost of increased rolling resistance compared to traditional caster wheels. The rolling resistance in omnidirectional wheels is higher than in many other wheels due to several factors including an irregular tread shape, material compliance, and friction in the bushinglike cross rollers during lateral motion. Testing standards exist for characterizing the rolling resistance, compressive strength, and other attributes of commonly used wheels such as caster wheels. However, there are no comprehensive testing standards or research that broadly characterize the performance of omnidirectional wheels. Here, test methods are described for characterizing the load relaxation, stiffness, and rolling resistance of omnidirectional wheels, and the results from these tests are presented. Test apparatuses for static loading and rolling resistance were created. Test results were analyzed to determine important factors for determining the ultimate compressive strength in static loading and the rolling resistance coefficient of an array of omnidirectional wheels, and results indicate wheel manufacturing methods and materials are the most important factors for determining these responses."

    "Controlling nano- and microscale morphology is essential for tailoring the appearance of structurally colored stretchy films. An effective approach for controlling the optical properties of such color-dynamic photonic films, which are manufactured holographically, is demonstrated using two simple control handles: the texture of the photonic structure and the surface roughness of a transmissive topcoat. Texture of the photonic structure affects the spectral signature and angular distribution of reflected light. Surface roughness of the topcoat affects the angular distribution of incident and reflected light. Fourier optics concepts are harnessed for modeling and predicting the optical characteristics of the materials as a function of their photonic texture and topcoat roughness. The model is verified with data obtained by imaging the angular scattering distribution and spectroscopic analysis of four representative combinations of photonic texture and surface coat roughness. The findings presented in this thesis validate the hypothesis that controlling texture of the photonic film and roughness of its topcoat allows for tailoring the visual appearance of structurally colored materials. This approach provides access to a rich design space of different appearances, including strong iridescence, color constancy with collimated light sources at small angles of incidence, pure and muted colors, and specular and highly diffuse reflections."

    "This study introduces a novel approach to tissue-on-chip device fabrication using low-cost picosecond laser ablation, addressing critical limitations in current manufacturing methods such as soft lithography, particularly in terms of material compatibility, feature resolution, and scalability. We developed a comprehensive finite element method (FEM) model for the laser ablation process, incorporating key physical phenomena including laser-material interactions, heat transfer, and material removal dynamics. This model, validated against experimental results, accurately predicts ablation depths within 20% of measured values across a range of laser parameters. Our experimental setup, utilizing a cost-effective 10 kHz picosecond laser system, demonstrates superior capabilities in creating high-aspect-ratio microchannels exceeding 20:1, surpassing traditional manufacturing techniques. We achieve precise control over channel dimensions, with widths ranging from 20 to 500 micrometers and depths up to 1 mm, while maintaining sub-micron surface roughness (Ra < 0.8 \ud835\udf07m). The system\u2019s versatility is showcased through the fabrication of complex structures such as Tesla valves and high-resolution text features, with a minimum feature size of 20 \ud835\udf07m. We present practical techniques for component selection and process parameter optimization 3 using our simulation, reducing expensive and time-consuming experimentation. This work establishes low-cost picosecond laser ablation as a viable and advantageous method for tissue-on-chip manufacturing. With fabrication times of 6-8 minutes for small features and less than an hour for a full chip, our method represents a significant advancement in rapid prototyping capabilities. These findings demonstrate that laser ablation is a powerful technique for manufacturing tissueon-chip devices, offering high resolution, flexibility, and scalability. This approach has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional methods, enabling the next generation of sophisticated, physiologically relevant in vitro models for biomedical research and drug development. The successful development and validation of the FEM model, coupled with practical demonstrations, provide a solid foundation for further advancements in laser-based fabrication of tissue-on-chip devices, potentially accelerating drug discovery processes and enabling more accessible production of personalized medicine platforms."

    "The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is deemed a sustainable energy source; however, developing green, earth-abundant, and efficient noble-metal-free catalysts for efficient ORR in different media remains a grand challenge. Herein, we present a scalable, facile, environmentally benign, and one-pot strategy for the fabrication of eco-friendly nitrogen-enriched graphitic-like hierarchical porous sub-100 nm carbon (denoted as N-HMPC) nanocapsules with controllable N-content for ORR. The synthesis route is based on in situ organic-organic self-assembly of Pluronic F127 copolymer micelles and resorcinol\u2013melamine\u2013formaldehyde in the presence of a silica template followed by carbonization and eroding the silica core. The as-formed N-HMPC nanocapsules have a core\u2013shell morphology (\u223c84 nm), hierarchical porosity, high surface area of (790 m2 g\u22121), and tunable nitrogen content (9\u201325%). Intriguingly, N-HMPC nanocapsules exhibit an analogous ORR activity to the commercial Pt/C catalyst (20% Pt) in the alkaline and acidic electrolytes, besides superior durability and inimitable tolerance to methanol and CO poisonings due to the hollow core\u2013shell architecture and abundant nitrogen. A judicious combination of experimental and density functional theory (DFT) simulations delineated the ORR pathway and mechanism for N-HMPC in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The presented approach may open new avenues for the rational design of metal-free green electrocatalysts for ORR."

    "Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) are the critical growth engines that develop the economy and society and improve our lives overall. However, women are underrepresented in STEM, which means 50% of the world's brain power is untapped. We know that, in general, women face unique barriers and challenges than men, such as gender bias and stereotypes. However, we know less about the unique obstacles and challenges women face in STEM and even less about overcoming the barriers in STEM. This research aims to identify the challenges faced by women in STEM and to gain a practical understanding of what women can do to evolve as leaders. As STEM is extremely broad, this thesis focused on studying the 11 female Nobel laureates who won the prize after 2000 under the three STEM-related Nobel categories: physics, chemistry, and medicine or physiology.\r\n\r\nFirst, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to understand the study results of existing barriers faced by women in STEM and the enablers that can increase the likelihood of women's success in STEM. Next, data were collected about the 11 Women STEM Noble laureates, including their biographies, life stories, newspaper reports, and interview transcripts. The thematic analysis was then adopted to analyze the collected data, in which four themes are identified and presented: 1) Overcome Barriers and Challenges; 2) Qualities of a Good Scientist; 3) Supportive Systems; 4) Impactful, Humanity, Innovative. Finally, the findings are summarized in relation to the research objectives to provide insights for women who want to pursue a STEM career."

    "Soft particulate gels include materials we can eat, squeeze, or 3D print. From foods to bio-inks to cement hydrates, these gels are composed of a small amount of particulate matter (proteins, polymers, colloidal particles, or agglomerates of various origins) embedded in a continuous fluid phase. The solid components assemble to form a porous matrix, providing rigidity and control of the mechanical response, despite being the minority constituent. The rheological response and gel elasticity are direct functions of the particle volume fraction \u03d5: however, the diverse range of different functional dependencies reported experimentally has, to date, challenged efforts to identify general scaling laws. Here we reveal a hidden hierarchical organization of fractal elements that controls the viscoelastic spectrum, and which is associated with the spatial heterogeneity of the solid matrix topology. The fractal elements form the foundations of a viscoelastic master curve, which we construct using large-scale 3D microscopic simulations of model gels, and can be described by a recursive rheological ladder model over a range of particle volume fractions and gelation rates. The hierarchy of the fractal elements provides the missing general framework required to predict the gel elasticity and the viscoelastic response of these ubiquitous complex materials."

    "Autonomy is crucial for underwater vehicles due to the challenging and inaccessible nature of underwater environments. These environments pose significant difficulties for human-operated systems because of limited visibility, high pressure, and vast areas that are costly and risky to explore manually. Implementing autonomy in underwater vehicles presents unique challenges due to the marine environment's harsh and complex nature. Underwater communication is severely limited as water absorbs and scatters most electromagnetic signals used in terrestrial communications. This necessitates the use of acoustic communication, which has a lower bandwidth and is prone to delays and signal distortion. Similarly, GPS signals do not penetrate water, complicating navigation and creating dependence on inertial and sonar sensors, which suffer from noisy measurements that are guaranteed to drift over time. The unpredictable dynamics of underwater environments, including varying currents, lighting conditions and obstacles, further complicate autonomous navigation. As such, data collection while moving through a preplanned course is the traditional mission of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), defining the limitation of current technology. Higher-level missions such as search, surveillance, maintenance and manipulation require greater situational awareness, decision-making and navigation abilities, facilitated by processing semantic visual information and applying it to map generation and localization. To address the limited autonomy of current AUVs and enhance their capability for complex missions, this thesis presents the development and evaluation of a real-time, monocular visual-inertial semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system for underwater environments, implemented on the cost-effective BlueROV2 platform. The research aims to enhance AUV autonomy and enable complex underwater missions through improved navigation and semantic mapping capabilities. Key contributions include the integration of a custom-trained object detector for underwater environments, adaptation of a hybrid SLAM algorithm combining Gaussian and Non-Gaussian landmarks for underwater operation, preliminary assessment of the SLAM system's accuracy using motion capture-based ground truth measurements, and comparative evaluation of the developed semantic SLAM system against state-of-the-art alternatives in an indoor pool experiment using the BlueROV2. This work addresses the challenges of underwater navigation and semantic mapping, offering a potential solution to extend the operational capabilities and mission complexity of affordable AUV platforms."

    "Biofuels hold great promise for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and boosting engine performance. Modeling biofuel combustion and pyrolysis chemistry with chemical kinetic models allows for high-throughput evaluation of their performance under various conditions. These models, typically comprising hundreds of species and thousands of elementary reactions, provide quantitative predictions for the investigated systems. While manually creating such mechanisms is labor-intensive and requires extensive knowledge, reaction mechanism generation software, such as the Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG), greatly facilitates model development by automating the selection of relevant species and reactions, as well as estimating their thermochemical, kinetic, and transport parameters. Despite the advances in these software packages and their success in modeling small, simple conventional fuels, their application to novel, under-explored biofuels is often limited due to a lack of knowledge in the relevant chemical space. This gap can be bridged by expanding the software's access to accurate thermochemical and kinetic parameters. However, these data are scarce, and their acquisition, typically via quantum chemical calculations, is challenging on a large scale. \r\n\r\nThis thesis addresses these challenges by developing automated workflows to enhance the calculation of accurate thermochemical and kinetic parameters, thereby extending the capabilities of RMG for biofuel modeling. First, an automatic thermochemistry calculation workflow is implemented and integrated into the chemical kinetic model development process. The significant improvement in computational capacity enables an iterative approach to model generation and refinement, where the thermochemistry of hundreds of molecules is refined in each iteration. This approach is validated through the modeling of light alkene combustion chemistry, resulting in a model that accurately predicts key combustion properties and outperforms other well-regarded models. This study highlights the necessity of sufficient refinement iterations for a comprehensive exploration of the relevant chemical space and the convergence of critical species and reactions in the chemical kinetic model. This approach is then applied to model less-studied biofuels, such as butyl acetate isomers and tetramethylethylene. By incorporating key kinetic parameters from literature and quantum chemical calculations, along with iteratively refined thermochemistry, the developed models demonstrate strong predictive capabilities. These models agree with experiments conducted after their development and reveal important reaction pathways in the studied systems.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this thesis enhances the acquisition of accurate kinetic parameters through the simultaneous development of software, datasets, and data-driven models. RDMC, a cheminformatics software, is developed, featuring toolkits for elementary reaction analysis and end-to-end automated workflows for generating molecular and transition state conformers. A dataset covering nine reaction types relevant to combustion and pyrolysis radical chemistry is created using the RDMC workflow. Concurrently, another radical reaction dataset is curated, covering different reaction types. In total, the two datasets introduce high-quality elementary reaction data for over 11,000 radical reactions. Eventually, a graph neural network is trained on the new dataset for fast kinetic parameter estimation that can potentially benefit chemical kinetic model development."

    "Intracellular bacterial pathogens secrete effectors to manipulate the host cell environment, create a hospitable niche, and promote infection. While many effectors interact with specific host machinery to perform a single distinct function, some effectors are capable of interaction with multiple host proteins to carry out multiple functions. Rickettsia species are obligate intracellular bacteria that cause vector-borne diseases that constitute an ongoing public health threat. As Rickettsia spp. have small genomes, and thus a limited coding capacity, multifunctional effectors may be an efficient way to manipulate their host environment. However, relatively few secreted effectors have been characterized in the Rickettsia genus and even fewer have been identified as multifunctional effectors. \r\n\r\nIn this work, I demonstrate that the rickettsial secreted effector Sca4 interacts with the host endocytic factor clathrin heavy chain. As previous work showed that Sca4 interacts with the host protein vinculin in mammalian cells, this discovery of the Sca4-clathrin interaction makes Sca4 one of the first multifunctional effectors to be identified in a Rickettsia species. When investigating the potential role of the Sca4-clathrin interaction, I found that clathrin promotes the cell-to-cell spread of R. parkeri in mammalian cells by acting in the recipient cell. However, the Sca4-clathrin interaction was found to be dispensable for efficient cell-to-cell spread. I investigated the role of this interaction in the tick arthropod vector and found that the Sca4-clathrin interaction is necessary for the efficient proliferation of R. parkeri in tick cells. These findings show that knowledge of the complete roles of rickettsial secreted effectors in both arthropod vector and mammalian hosts is needed to fully understand rickettsial pathogenesis."

    "The East Greenland Coastal Current (EGCC) carries some of the freshest outflow from the Arctic southward along the East Greenland Shelf and into the Nordic Seas and subpolar North Atlantic. How this fresh water initially flows onto the Northeast Greenland Shelf (NEGS) and feeds the EGCC is not well known due in part to the lack of observations in the region. In this thesis, I use two ocean reanalyses, the Regional Arctic Ocean/sea-ice Reanalysis (RARE) and Global Ocean Physics Reanalysis (GLORYS) to explore the structure and dynamics of the ocean circulation on the NEGS. To validate the use of these products in the region, I compare the reanalysis products to the Fram Strait Arctic Outflow Observatory for the period of 2003-2019. In the mean, RARE is too warm and salty compared to the moorings, while the properties in GLORYS track more closely to the observations. However, the observed velocity field is better represented in RARE than GLORYS. From there, I analyze the cross-shelfbreak flow from 74\u00b0N to 81.5\u00b0N in the two reanalysis products, and conclude that transport onto the NEGS of waters fresher than 34 salinity is driven by an Ekman circulation that arises from along-shelfbreak winds and a widening shelf south of 81.5\u00b0N. The enhanced transport of fresh water also shifts the isohalines across the shelfbreak, directing a geostrophic flow onshelf between 81\u00b0N and 79\u00b0N. The convergence of fresh water on the NEGS initiates the EGCC as an identifiable and distinct feature around 80\u00b0N in RARE, uniting the EGCC along the southwest coast of Greenland and its northern counterpart, the Polar Surface Water (PSW) Jet. In GLORYS, the EGCC is not present throughout the domain, though there is a weak net southward flow on the NEGS. The EGCC in RARE is primarily buoyancy-driven, though the along-coast winds likely play a major role in maintaining the density front that supports the EGCC. Results from this thesis have implications for the transport and fate of Arctic and Greenland-sourced fresh water, and stratification in the high latitude North Atlantic and Nordic Seas."

    "The advent of graphics processing units (GPUs) has brought computing to new heights with deep learning models, now deployed ubiquitously and touching the lives of many. While GPU hardware may be ideal for deep learning, its full potential in various scientific computing applications has yet to be realized. Often, paradigm shifts in the data formalisms and algorithmic choices used to solve scientific computing problems must take place to fully leverage GPUs. A quintessential example of this shift has been the move towards matrix-free, high-order finite element formulations researched under the Exascale Computing Project. Similar groundbreaking shifts are only starting to take place in continuous energy Monte Carlo (MC) neutron transport simulations. These simulations play a crucial role in designing fission, fusion, and security systems that may play a pivotal role in the transition to a decarbonized world. This work contributes to adapting continuous energy MC neutron transport simulations for the GPU computing era. We first summarize some changes made to other scientific computing applications that led to performance gains on GPUs, which informed our independent development of a CUDA-based version of OpenMC, an open-source continuous energy MC neutron and photon transport code. Fortunately, the historical event-based MC simulation modality developed extensively through the 1980s for vector computers provides an excellent basis for GPU computing. Adapting a full-physics, continuous energy MC neutron transport simulation for GPUs is a feat only completed by a few institutions across the world, so we share some software development tricks that facilitated this task. We then identify a variety of algorithmic optimizations that improved the performance of the baseline CUDA application, and identify areas for further development. 3 Based on experience adapting a full-physics continuous energy MC code for GPU, we identify two pieces of the simulation which can be improved for GPU computing: resonance upscatter handling and unresolved resonance modeling. Our new method for modeling resonance upscatter is based on a novel, fundamental observation regarding the resonance upscatter effect. The relative speed tabulation (RST) method developed by other GPU MC researchers can be underpinned by a universal special function we have named the incomplete Faddeeva function, which is closely related to the incomplete Goodwin-Staton integral. Our research develops numerical algorithms for efficient, accurate computation of the incomplete Faddeeva function and identifies some properties of the function. We then present a specialized root-finding algorithm that takes advantage of the structure of the problem to efficiently sample the resonance upscatter effect on GPUs. This obviates the need to rely on RST tables or a zero kelvin pointwise cross section, freeing precious GPU memory while using a GPU-friendly memory access pattern. Continuing in the same direction, we focus on unresolved resonance region (URR) crosssection modeling, which was shown to induce a 30% computational efficiency degradation on GPUs. We review the requirements to model cross sections in the unresolved resonance regime, and provide what is to our knowledge the first rigorous demonstration that URR modeling can be reduced to a one-dimensional probabilistic model in addition to some expectation values of partial cross sections conditioned on the total. Through three asymptotic arguments covering different resonant behavior regimes, we show that the normal inverse Gaussian distribution is the natural choice for modeling the total neutron cross-section distribution. Rather than inducing a performance degradation, we show the new URR modeling technique in fact outperforms a pointwise infinite-dilute approach when it is used to model the URR region."

    "Prelithiation is a method to improve the energy density and cycle life of lithium-ion batteries, and contact prelithiation of the graphite anode using thin lithium foil is a promising technique. However, producing thin lithium foil below 5 \u03bcm is extremely challenging, making it difficult to achieve precise prelithiation with lithium metal. Additionally, pure thin Li foil suffers from drawbacks such as low lithium utilization, debris formation, and scalability issues. To address these challenges, we developed a straightforward doctor blade method to cast molten lithium onto a carbon nanotube (CNT) film, resulting in a thin and ultra-light Li-CNT film. The increasing lithiophilicity of the CNT film induced by lithiation enables the uniform casting of molten lithium onto its surface. The method enables adjustable lithium capacities ranging from 0.1 to 1.12 mA h cm\u22122 or higher by controlling the amount of cast lithium. The Li-CNT films show high specific capacities and nearly 100% lithium utilization owing to their exceptional conductive network, porous structure, and electrolyte-philic nature, which facilitates the efficient transport of both electrons and lithium ions. To achieve prelithiation of the graphite anode when paired with commercial LFP electrodes of \u223c3.3 mA h cm\u22122, our Li-CNT film significantly enhances the initial Coulombic efficiency of the LFP||Gr full cell from 89% to 100%, fully compensating for the initial loss of active lithium ions caused by solid electrolyte interface formation. Furthermore, the Li-CNT film has superior mechanical properties, positioning it as a viable candidate for practical applications in lithium-ion batteries."

    "2D materials are a rising class of soft matter material with a promising set of unique characteristics. The most ubiquitous 2D material, graphene, for example, possesses large surface areas, tunability, and unique electrical, optical, and catalytic properties while being lightweight, strong, and flexible. This has led to graphene seeing use in separations, biomedical applications, flexible electronics, and more. Meanwhile, synthetic 2D polymers, a relatively new field of study, represent a massive expansion of the design space for 2D materials and their applications. Solution processing of these materials is often an important step for synthesizing or applying them, necessitating knowledge of their behavior in suspensions and in flows. As these materials become more viable, our fundamental understanding of them must increase in tandem. This will inform us in designing these materials for our desired applications. However, especially when compared to their 1D counterparts, our understanding of 2D materials is lacking. It is the goal of this thesis to help fill in this gap in knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 1, we discuss the basics of soft matter and methods for simulating which are the basis for understanding the work in this thesis. We present and discuss the governing equations for the movement of soft matter particles. We then discuss the simulation methodology and mobility tensor approximations used in this thesis along with some additional considerations.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 2 we study methods for simulating constrained Brownian systems. We compare the current state-of-the-art method for these simulations, GMRES, to a different method called the projected conjugate gradient (PrCG) method. In particular, we compared PrCG and GMRES for rigid bodies, freely jointed chains, and immobile systems. We find that both methods exhibit the same linear computational complexity. We find that PrCG, however, exhibits some notable advantages over GMRES including lower precomputational and storage burdens, a guaranteed feasible iterate, and trivial extension to new constraint types due to the lack of a preconditioner. We use PrCG to solve a mixed constraint problem with rigid body and immobile particles, comparing to the analytical solution at large separations.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of this thesis studies the effects of self-attraction on self-avoiding, semi-flexible, athermal 2D materials (sheets) in shear flow. In Chapter 3, we give a background on rheology and 2D materials which are necessary for understanding the remaining chapters. We begin by discussing non-Newtonian fluids, specifically their applications and affect on the momentum balance presented in Chapter 1. Then, we give a brief introduction on simple shear and discuss how it is implemented in simulations. Finally, we give a brief introduction to 2D materials, their applications, as well as previous experimental, theoretical, and computational work.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 4, we model self-interacting, self-avoiding, semi-flexible, athermal sheets in shear flow. We find a rich conformational landscape of 4 different behaviors --- flat, tumbling, 1D folded, and 2D folded --- which are well-delineated by several dimensionless groups representing the ratios between shear strength and interaction strength, and bending rigidity and interaction strength. We use these dimensionless groups to explain the observed behaviors, explain the folding behavior of 1D folded sheets, and calculate and explain the viscosity of a dilute suspension of these sheets. We use the conformational and rotational properties of the sheet simulations to explain this behavior, demonstrating a new explanation for the non-monotonic rheological properties of 2D materials which does not involve sheet-sheet interactions (which are rare in dilute suspensions) or thermal energy (which is often small in sheet systems). We also study systems with two initially stacked sheets in order to model, for example, shear exfoliation of 2D materials. We find three behaviors --- separating, waltzing, and flipping --- which are characterized by the same dimensionless groups as single sheets. We again explain these behaviors and calculate the viscosity of these sheets which again shows interesting non-monotonic rheological properties which we also explain using the conformational and rotational properties of the sheets.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 5, we use simple time-dependent flow protocols to show how the properties of sheets can be controlled. Specifically, we use linear shear annealing simulations to show that the final conformational properties of a sheet suspension can be tuned continuously by varying the quench time. We also use our knowledge of the phase map of sheets to design flow protocols with step changes in shear rate to produce a target state of highly aligned, 1D folded sheets which represents, among other things, our predicted lowest possible viscosity for a sheet suspension.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 6, we discuss potential future directions for the sheet model applied in Chapters 4 and 5. Specifically, we discuss loose ends from Chapter 4 and potential extensions of the model. We discuss potential benefits of and complications in exploring these directions.\r\n\r\nFinally, in Chapter 7, we summarize the discoveries presented in this thesis and provide concluding remarks."

    "There are six long-lived fission products (LLFPs) identified in nuclear spent fuel, which account for at least 99% of the long-term radiotoxicity once actinide recycling is completed. This thesis examines the feasibility of using proton beams to transmute LLFPs into shorterlived or stable isotopes. While long-term storage for high-level waste would still be necessary, transmuting the LLFPs can reduce the volume of waste material that needs to be stored. The objectives of this research are to explore the design of a proton transmutation facility, as well as to determine the optimal LLFP target-blanket material configuration for maximizing the transmutation efficiency. This thesis analyzes the use of intermediate energy beams of 18-70 MeV from commercial cyclotrons for transmutation. This thesis also analyzes the use of 1000 MeV proton beams to generate a substantial number of secondary neutrons through spallation interactions with target materials. The secondary neutrons produced from the spallation process are utilized by the LLFP materials, while surrounding blanket materials are selected to enhance the transmutation efficiency. PHITS, a Monte Carlo transport code, is employed to computationally model the interactions between LLFP materials and the proton beam. In this thesis, PHITS is used to estimate the flux-energy spectrum and the number of atoms irradiated in the LLFP target during beam interaction. This data is then post-processed using a 0-dimensional analysis in FISPACT to estimate the transmutation rate for each LLFP. PHITS is also used to find the depletion rate of the LLFPs for the 18-70 MeV beam case and for spallation-induced transmutations in the 1000 MeV case. Geant4, a Monte Carlo transport toolkit, is used to calculate the production rate of particles attributed to the spallation process. Analysis of the performance of commercial cyclotrons with energies of 18-70 MeV indicates that transmutation rates increase with higher proton beam energy. A cyclotron with a beam current of 10 mA and beam energy of 70 MeV running continuously can transmute 15.401 \u00b1 0.069 g/year of Tc-99. However, Tc-99 is produced at a rate of approximately 8.54 kg/year in a 1 GW reactor, suggesting that a single commercial cyclotron beam is currently not viable for transmutation purposes. A proposed tank design with a lead/Tc-99 target that is surrounded by LLFP pins and heavy water is considered for the spallation study. Although using Tc-99 as a target directly transmutes 0.893 \u00b1 0.002 kg/year from transmutation attributed to spallation, using lead as a target instead approximately doubles the transmutation rates in the LLFP regions for almost all of the LLFP isotopes. In both cases, the depletion rate of the LLFPs is greatly increased compared to using a commercial cyclotron of 70 MeV. A proton spallation source 3 with a beam current of 10 mA and beam energy of 1000 MeV, using a Tc-99 target, achieves a transmutation rate of approximately 10.9 kg/year of Tc-99 in the LLFP pins through secondary neutrons produced by the spallation process. In contrast, using a lead target achieves a higher transmutation rate of around 20.0 kg/year of Tc-99 in the LLFP pins. This work was supported by the DOE ARPA-E Project under the award number DEAR0001578."

    "Recreating the physical behavior of fluids from real-world footage remains a significant challenge, particularly for non-Newtonian fluids. This work introduces a novel method that combines neural radiance fields (NeRF), which map 3D scene coordinates to color and density using deep neural networks, with the material point method (MPM), a simulation technique that represents materials as moving points capable of large deformation. Our approach aims to accurately recover physical parameters and achieve high-fidelity 3D reconstructions from single-view videos of fluids, even those with complex rheological behaviors like shear thinning and thickening. In this study, we apply our method to a Herschel-Bulkley fluid, namely ketchup, under two different real-world conditions: a 50mm column collapse and being squeezed from a bottle. By leveraging the differentiable nature of NeRF and the fluid simulation capabilities of MPM, our approach extracts parameters from real-world footage after initially training on approximate geometry derived from virtual models. The actual video footage is then used to estimate initial velocities and retrieve constitutive parameters, including modulus, yield stress, and viscosity. The iterative optimization process, which integrates continuous feedback between the NeRF-MPM simulation and the video data, enables us to extract constitutive parameters from real footage and perform predictive simulations that closely reflect the behavior observed in the training videos. Key results include the retrieval of constitutive parameters, such as modulus, yield stress, and viscosity, as well as reconstructed videos that reflect the fluid behavior observed in the training video. The results demonstrate that our method can reconstruct the fluid\u2019s flow behavior from limited perspectives, accurately enough to visually reproduce the flow, showcasing its flexibility and robustness. This work not only validates the approach through 3 a series of experiments but also highlights the potential for differentiable rendering and simulation techniques to advance our understanding and simulation of complex material dynamics, particularly in cases where direct measurements are challenging or impossible."

    "Laser-inscribed graphene (LIG) is an emerging material for micro-electronic applications and is being used to develop supercapacitors, soft actuators, triboelectric generators, and sensors. The fabrication technique is simple, yet the batch-to-batch variation of LIG quality is not well documented in the literature. In this study, we conduct experiments to characterize batch-to-batch variation in the manufacturing of LIG electrodes for applications in electrochemical sensing. Numerous batches of 36 LIG electrodes were synthesized using a CO2 laser system on polyimide film. The LIG material was characterized using goniometry, stereomicroscopy, open circuit potentiometry, and cyclic voltammetry. Hydrophobicity and electrochemical screening (cyclic voltammetry) indicate that LIG electrode batch-to-batch variation is less than 5% when using a commercial reference and counter electrode. Metallization of LIG led to a significant increase in peak current and specific capacitance (area between anodic/cathodic curve). However, batch-to-batch variation increased to approximately 30%. Two different platinum electrodeposition techniques were studied, including galvanostatic and frequency-modulated electrodeposition. The study shows that formation of metallized LIG electrodes with high specific capacitance and peak current may come at the expense of high batch variability. This design tradeoff has not been discussed in the literature and is an important consideration if scaling sensor designs for mass use is desired. This study provides important insight into the variation of LIG material properties for scalable development of LIG sensors. Additional studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanism(s) of this variability so that strategies to improve the repeatability may be developed for improving quality control. The dataset from this study is available via an open access repository."

    "Singular value decomposition (SVD) is an essential matrix factorization technique that decomposes a matrix into singular values and corresponding singular vectors that form orthonormal bases. SVD has wide-ranging applications from principal component analysis (PCA) to matrix completion and approximation. Methods for computing the SVD of a matrix are extensive and involve optimization algorithms with some theoretical guarantees, though many of these techniques are not scalable in nature. We show the efficacy of a distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm by implementing parallelized alternating least squares and prove theoretical guarantees for its convergence and empirical results, which allow for the development of a simple framework for solving SVD in a correct, scalable, and easily optimizable manner."

    "FrED (Fiber Extrusion Device) Factory is a manufacturing facility at MIT which educates its students on fundamental and advanced manufacturing principals. The factory produces multiple FrED devices, which are \"desktop fiber extrusion systems that mimic continuous fiber draw process for hands-on learning and/or laboratory experience on data acquisition, control system, and smart manufacturing. It allows learners to perform experiments, vary manufacturing parameters and control system, collect data, and perform analysis.\" [1] This year\u2019s thesis work builds off of the progress from 2023, which aimed to produce a low cost variant of earlier versions of the FrED. In 2024, the aim for the lab was to implement design refinements, design for manufacturing, design the assembly line, design packaging, develop supply chain using Tulip, develop educational content, perform user testing, and execute pilot runs. The focus of this thesis will be on design refinements related to graphical user interface (GUI), inclusion of threading for improvement to program speed, and characterization of performance related to diameter control as well as advancements in educational content development, user testing, production level assembly, and pilot runs. The results of this thesis include significant improvements made to the FrED device such as a user-controlled GUI as well as close-loop controls. Furthermore, key components of the device were quantified such as fps rate of the USB camera and motor stability which aided in understanding how diameter control and modulation can be implemented in future work. At the time of submission, there were inherent complications still not understood about the FrED that limited its potential as an end user product. Some complications included reliability of the diameter reading from the USB camera, physics of the hot glue preform, and motor speed assumptions which did not perform well under close-loop testing (spool speed going to 0 in order to make the diameter larger consequently prevents the camera from reading any future diameter measurements which is problematic). In terms of pilot runs, user testing, and educational content development, the results were promising. 78.3% of the 23 user testing respondents at Venture Cafe said they were interested in receiving a FrED and getting access to more learning content. Suggestions were made by the users for future work and implementation. Educational content was developed for mass flow and data acquisition, however, a formal pilot run session where this could be tested for feedback was not performed."

    "Granular intrusion processes such as sand locomotion, uprooting, and digging are commonly present. While these phenomena can be accurately modeled via discrete element methods and continuum models, this accuracy comes at a great computational cost, especially for large systems. Granular Resistive Force Theory (RFT) is a reduced-order, rateindependent model that has been shown to successfully capture the motion of rigid intruders in granular media, with a reduced computational cost. RFT is based on a rate-independent theory that calculates the force experienced by a body using its direction of velocity. This makes it difficult to handle scenarios that are near-stagnant which occur frequently in uprooting of plants. To overcome this limitation, we introduce elastic RFT (eRFT) which is based on a rate-independent plasticity flow-rule\u2013like criterion, and pair it with deformable intruders. We focus on modeling uprooting processes which inherently have flexible intruders and are often dynamically controlled. This allows us to address both previously mentioned shortcomings of RFT (stagnancy and flexible intruders) at once. By combining eRFT with a nonlinear beam theory to represent slender, inextensible roots we create a speedy computational tool. Using MATLAB, we simulate various uprooting scenarios to better understand anchoring mechanisms of different root geometries. We showcase the validity of eRFT results by comparing them to experimental data. To implement eRFT in ABAQUS, we make use of an existing user subroutine which allows the study of a broader range of intruder materials and shapes. While the subroutine has its limitations, initial comparisons to computational and experimental results are demonstrative."

    "As of the year 2020, the accumulated mass of anthropogenic materials now outweighs all living biomass on Earth. Industrial material production simultaneously contributes nearly 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions each year, which in conjunction with solid waste accumulation and deterioration of ecological processes, threatens the livelihood of current and future generations of both human and non-human species. This is in dramatic contrast with natural materials, which consistently outperform human engineering, yet are invariably produced using abundant, renewable sources of energy and upon their disuse, decompose to fuel new growth. Nature effectively forms sustainable supply chains with no waste by leveraging both the constituents of materials and their structural organization at multiple scales, architecting common and abundant building blocks into a variety of high-performing composites. In this thesis, we present a nature-centered materiomics approach to emulate this in the design of novel sustainable materials. We leverage both computational and experimental strategies to consider multiple length-scales and time-scales across the processing, structure, properties, and performance of material systems with minimal ecological impact. First, we demonstrate machine learning strategies for harnessing functional geometries in natural materials and demonstrate how interpretable models can be leveraged toward novel material design. Next, we develop a platform for the fabrication of tunable biocomposites composed of renewable and biodegradable feedstocks, and consider Bayesian optimization as an approach to guide composite optimization and design. Finally, we extend the fabrication system to hybrid-living materials and demonstrate dynamic bio-welding capabilities in the strongest mycelium-based material in the literature to-date. Altogether, these contributions enhance multiscale understanding of nature-centered material design and pave the way for future innovations that align human engineering with regenerative material cycles."

    "We present the design, implementation and evaluation of MilliNavigator, an autonomous navigation system for drones capable of mapping, path-planning, self-localizing, and navigating in indoor environments by leveraging strategically-placed millimeter wave anchors. Autonomous drones are an increasingly relevant tool for completing and automating hard-to-reach tasks. State of the art navigation systems rely primarily on cameras and GPS for environmental perception and self-localization. These solutions can impose restrictions on existing systems, which limit their navigable environment to well-lit, outdoors, and unobstructed paths. This thesis presents MilliNavigator, the first system to use millimeter wave radar and anchor-aware path planning to achieve high accuracy, 6DOF, online localization. By generating a localization precision score map from known anchor deployments, the system jointly optimizes travel distance and localization performance. We implemented and evaluated MilliNavigator on a drone built with commercial, off-the-shelf parts. We ran over 165 successful missions across 7 different tag deployments. Our system successfully achieved 7.9cm overall median error and had a 90th percentile error of less than 21cm."

    "The design of modern composite materials, as used in a wide range of engineering applications, is largely derived from a traditional framework based on laminates. While resulting in desirable strength and stiffness properties, the laminate-based structure leads to a high degree of anisotropy and unique failure modalities like interlaminar failure, limiting the performance of these composites under complex loading conditions. Meanwhile, recent work in the field of architected materials has yielded a thorough understanding of geometry-dependent material behavior, enabling the development of highly robust architectures with tunable (an)isotropy. However, such advances have focused primarily on describing the response of lightweight architected geometries comprised mostly of air. The effect of adding a load-bearing matrix is not well understood. Here we investigate the effect of geometry and constituent material properties on the mechanics of 3D-architected interpenetrating phase composite (IPC) materials, i.e., two-phase materials consisting of an architected structure surrounded by a matrix. Using computational homogenization, we first predict how resultant coupled stress states in the composite change with the material properties of each individual phase and contextualize the results within traditional stiffness scaling laws. We then demonstrate two robust fabrication pathways for realizing polymer- and carbon-based centimeter-scale architected IPCs with micro-scale features. Using these prototypes, we study the mechanical behavior of the fabricated composites under uniaxial compression, with particular emphasis on the non-linear and failure regimes. We show that independent of the material system, the presence of a load-bearing matrix distributes the stress in the composite, contributing to a high-strength, globally stretchingdominated failure behavior, regardless of nodal connectivity. Moreover, the development of a 3D, highly tortuous pathway for stress delays or prevents catastrophic failure of the traditionally brittle architecture phase, resulting in energy dissipation performance of the composite that exceeds the sum of its individual constituents. Finally, we demonstrate that the composite stress state can be architected using geometric design of the IPC and introduce an example of tunable mechanical response in an architected composite inspired by traditional auxetic metamaterials. Altogether, this work broadens our established understanding of the link between architecture and mechanical performance by considering the framework of interpenetrating phase composites, creating the foundation for a new class of strong, resilient, and programmable materials with architected stress states."

    "The number of objects in Earth\u2019s orbit is increasing rapidly, raising urgency for intensified observations of satellites and other resident space objects (RSOs) to manage space traffic and prevent collisions. Current methods for RSO detection and tracking rely on ground-based and space-based observatories with optical or radar sensors, but these telescopes require complex scheduling to achieve surveillance of all objects. Previous works have implemented scheduling algorithms and machine learning models that optimize the assignment of tasks to the sensors for RSO observations. However, prior methodologies rely on different datasets, making it hard to make comparisons across methods. This paper presents satdatagen: a software package that generates datasets that can be used as inputs to sensor task schedulers. The datasets generated from the satdatagen library are intended to be used as a baseline input to satellite sensor task schedulers. The datasets contain information about every satellite that passes in view of the sensor such as its angle of altitude and its brightness. Additionally, actual cloud cover data is included for optical telescopes that need to take visibility into account while scheduling observations. satdatagen is simple to use, and does not require excess outside knowledge from developers of scheduling tools."

    "Fusion reactors utilizing deuterium and tritium fuel produce high-energy 14.1 MeV neutrons, necessitating a thorough understanding of their behavior for effective reactor design. Neutron transport codes play a critical role in determining key parameters such as tritium breeding ratio, neutron wall loading, and heat deposition, vital for assessing operational considerations. Monte Carlo (MC) radiation transport methods have become standard in fusion neutronics due to their ability to handle energy and angular variables continuously. However, manual modeling of complex fusion geometries with traditional constructive solid geometry (CSG) methods remains labor-intensive, prompting the integration of computer-aided design (CAD) models into MC radiation transport. This thesis investigates the integration of CAD-based geometry representations into MC radiation transport, focusing on computational performance implications of the Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo (DAGMC) approach. This work examines different neutronics model representations, including CSG, Unstructured Mesh (UM), and DAGMC for the practical solutions they can provide for fusion neutronics needs. Tracking algorithms associated with each representation are explored, highlighting UM and DAGMC\u2019s versatility in the way they integrate with CAD-based design processes. Performance comparison between CSG and DAGMC geometries in OpenMC is analyzed by evaluating particle simulation rates and memory usage across four progressively complex fusion-like models. Performance results reflect positively on DAGMC transport, but areas of future work are identified for more comprehensive results. From the lens of computational performance, this study contributes to determining the viability of CAD-based geometry representations for use in fusion-relevant MC radiation transport."

    "The development of the integrated Power Electronics Building Block (iPEBB) is key to the full electrification of future United States Navy ships. The creation of this modular, universal power converter takes full advantage of modern electronics; however, the high heat generation of these components, 9.6 kW from the MOSFET switches and 624 W from the transformer, makes thermal management crucial to their successful implementation. As a result of additional requirements, indirect liquid cooling using a detached cold plate is being studied; however, preliminary analysis revealed concerns regarding the hot spot temperatures of the transformer using this approach. This thesis explored the feasibility of using heat pipes to supplement the cooling provided by the cold plate to maintain iPEBB transformer core and coil temperatures below 100\u00b0C and 155\u00b0C respectively. First, experiments and analytical solutions were used to provide accurate estimates for the thermal conductivity values of the 3F36 ferrite and litz wire in the transformer. Then, a standalone thermal model of the transformer was built in StarCCM+ and used to test various cooling solutions, including forced airflow and heat pipe configurations. The proposed design utilized 16 copper-water heat pipes configured to provide alternative paths of heat flow for the regions of the transformer furthest from the cold plate. Shapal HiM Soft Machinable AlN ceramic was utilized to provide high voltage insulation, and electromagnetic simulations were used to estimate the induced losses in the heat pipes as a result of high frequency coil operations. Using a half-iPEBB thermal model, the final configuration, coupled with the cold plate cooled by 22\u00b0C deionized water at a flow rate of 0.37 kg/s, achieved a core maximum temperature of 99.7\u00b0C, coil maximum of 93.2\u00b0C, and MOSFET maximum of 144.6\u00b0C, all within their respective limits, while only adding a net weight of 0.29 kg to the iPEBB. The thermal results of this study showcase the effectiveness of heat pipes in the iPEBB and invite further analysis and experimentation to validate the electromagnetic implications of the concept. These results also contribute to the general ongoing study of heat pipe usage near high-frequency electronics."

    "Portfolio Optimization can be challenging due to the uncertainty about the value of a future asset. With recent developments in machine learning, there are significant prediction tools available that can be applied to portfolio selection. Financial markets are known to be dynamic and complex, but algorithms are designed to capture patterns in the data. In this paper, seven machine learning techniques are used for stock price prediction: Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, and LightGBM. Additionally, two hybrid machine learning methods are used for prediction: CNN-LSTM and BiLSTM-BO-LightGBM. After training the models, the algorithm creates an optimal portfolio of assets over a simulated year of trading. The symmetric mean absolute percentage error of the algorithms on unseen data evaluates the prediction power. The generated alpha and Sharpe ratio evaluate the quality of the constructed optimal portfolios under Mean-Variance Optimization. Using data on the 50 largest United States companies from January 2, 2019 to December 29, 2023, the results demonstrate that the hybrid models perform better than the individual models, and the CNN-LSTM model outperforms benchmark market indices."

    "Penetrant-induced plasticization has prevented the industrial deployment of many polymers for membrane-based gas separations. With the advent of microporous polymers, new structural design features and unprecedented property sets are now accessible under controlled laboratory conditions, but property sets can often deteriorate due to plasticization. Therefore, a critical understanding of the origins of plasticization in microporous polymers and the development of strategies to mitigate this effect are needed to advance this area of research. Herein, an integrative discussion is provided on seminal plasticization theory and gas transport models, and these theories and models are compared to an exhaustive database of plasticization characteristics of microporous polymers. Correlations between specific polymer properties and plasticization behavior are presented, including analyses of plasticization pressures from pure-gas permeation tests and mixed-gas permeation tests for pure polymers and composite films. Finally, an evaluation of common and current state-of-the-art strategies to mitigate plasticization is provided along with suggestions for future directions of fundamental and applied research on the topic."

    "The Fiber Extrusion Device (FrED) is a hands-on desktop tool designed to facilitate the teaching of manufacturing engineering concepts through remote laboratory experiences. FrED simulates the continuous fiber draw process used in various industries, including fiber optics, synthetic textiles, medical devices, aerospace, and construction. This device translates industrial-scale fiber draw towers into a compact version, allowing users to experiment with different parameters to understand their effects on manufacturing processes. Over the past three years, successive groups of MEng students have refined FrED\u2019s design with the goal of creating a robust, functional, and affordable device for in-house manufacturing at the MIT FrED Factory. While the 2023 model achieved significant cost reduction, it required further hardware and electronics refinement for stable and repeatable performance. This thesis encompasses two main objectives: enhancing the hardware design and assembly processes for the final 2024 educational FrED model, and developing an alternative design for an advanced FrED version suitable for academic lab settings to rapidly prototype synthetic fibers. The first objective was met by improving the two most dynamic sub-assemblies\u2014the gearbox and extrusion system\u2014to ensure smooth and consistent operation. Additionally, conjoining part tolerances and hardware insert locations and geometries within manufactured parts were verified and adjusted according to manufacturing standards. Multiple jigs were also designed and fabricated to facilitate the assembly process of the gearbox and extrusion sub-assemblies, and two new parts were created to enhance user operation of FrED. For the second objective, an enhanced version of FrED capable of handling a wider range of preform materials was developed by upgrading the extrusion sub-assembly to operate at temperatures over three times higher than the educational version. This feature had been previously attempted with older, more expensive versions of FrED but had not been pursued with the recent, more affordable iteration. The new high-temperature FrED successfully drew fibers from PLA, a biodegradable thermoplastic, using 3D printed preforms with distinctive geometries, demonstrating its potential for providing an affordable solution for rapid synthetic fiber prototyping in academic labs."

    "Software systems have increased in complexity over time, and with this increased complexity has come an increased need to keep these systems organized and functioning efficiently. Observability is closely attached to ensuring this correct and effective system function. Without system monitoring, it is difficult to pinpoint when errors occur and correct them at their sources. Monitoring systems also helps to understand a system from the outside by allowing developers to ask questions about the system\u2019s state and function without needing to know the details of what comprises the system\u2019s internal behavior. While there are existing solutions for observability frameworks, these solutions do not target microservice architectures, which are used more and more with expansive code bases, such as those likely to be employed in an industry environment. They also require extensive configuration to be fully integrated with a pre-existing system. As such, the challenge lies primarily in adapting observability solutions to a decentralized, microservice architecture found in an industry setting. The existing solutions also come with advantages and disadvantages for different situations, so they are often incomplete in addressing an entire system\u2019s needs. The integrated system created here satisfies our system\u2019s requirements of a consolidated observability platform while also enabling future customizations, thereby allowing problems to be identified more quickly and proactively."

    "Auricular reconstruction in children with microtia is one of the more complex procedures in plastic surgery. Obtaining sufficient native material to build an ear requires harvesting large fragments of rib cartilage in children. Herein, we investigated how to optimize autologous chondrocyte isolation, expansion and re-implantation using polyglycolic acid (PGA) scaffolds for generating enough cartilage to recapitulate a whole ear starting from a small ear biopsy. Ear chondrocytes isolated from human microtia subjects grew slower than microtia rib or healthy ear chondrocytes and displayed a phenotypic shift due to the passage number. Rabbit ear chondrocytes co-cultured with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) at a 50\u2006:\u200650 ratio recapitulated the cartilage biological properties in vitro. However, PGA scaffolds with different proportions of rabbit chondrocytes and MSC did not grow substantially in two months when subcutaneously implanted in immunosuppressed mice. In contrast, rabbit chondrocyte-seeded PGA scaffolds implanted in immunocompetent rabbits formed a cartilage 10 times larger than the original PGA scaffold. This cartilage mimicked the biofunctional and mechanical properties of an ear cartilage. These results indicate that autologous chondrocyte-seeded PGA scaffolds fabricated following our optimized procedure have immense potential as a solution for obtaining enough cartilage for auricular reconstruction and opens new avenues to redefine autologous cartilage replacement."

    "The measurement of hydrogen transport properties of molten salts like FLiBe is crucial for the development of advanced nuclear technologies like lithium-bearing liquid immersion breeding blankets for fusion reactors. Tritium production and the quantification of its mobility in these materials is necessary for efficient operation of these technologies. A common method of measuring these properties is with hydrogen permeation experiments. Hydrogen permeation experiments involve measuring the flux of hydrogen permeating through a substance, and from this flux transport properties like the diffusivity and solubility of hydrogen in the molten salt can be derived with various models of the experimental setup. This thesis describes the process of fabricating and assembling a HYdrogen PERmeatION (HYPERION) experiment and provides preliminary results of the functionality as well as some issues and troubleshooting of the experiment. Using the code Finite Element Simulation of Tritium In Materials (FESTIM), the experiment was also modeled. The models were used to explore the design parameter space of the experiment to determine the experiment\u2019s effectiveness in producing the desired result of accurately calculating the hydrogen transport properties of the molten salt. Through the process of modeling, the assumptions that were normally made when performing these experiments were called into question and their validity was quantified, suggesting that the experiments that have been previously conducted might have been significantly affected by these assumptions. Using these models could eventually improve the accuracy of measured transport properties for molten salts like FLiBe and other nuclear fusion-relevant molten salts and inform the design of hydrogen permeation experiments moving forward."

    "Beaches are dynamic, changing with tides, winds, and waves. Here, a beach was mapped daily for 3 weeks from the dune to the low-tide water line on the Outer Banks of North Carolina at the US Army Corps of Engineers Field Research Facility in Duck. The 22,500 m2 area of interest was surveyed daily by a walker carrying a GPS-equipped backpack and occasionally with a lidar equipped drone. Surveys of the northern region of interest also were collected with a stationary terrestrial lidar mounted on the dune. The observed morphological events include the destruction and formation of a cusp field during which there was 1.4 m of erosion and accretion associated with bays and horns, and the formation over 7 days of a ~1-m high ridge and runnel system. The GPS-equipped backpack apparatus was used as ground truth for estimates made with the lidar systems. Along both cross- and alongshore transects the lidar elevations were within approximately 0.05 m of those estimated by the backpack surveys, with RMS errors less than 0.11 m."

    "Over the past decade, aerial drones have been used to address problems in areas such as sensing and measurement, inspection, delivery, security, and defense. Adding a load attached to one or more drones using a flexible cable can significantly enhance the capabilities of these platforms. This work aims to develop a multi-drone platform, built on open-source tools such as PX4 and ROS2, that can be used to lift a general slung load in an outdoor environment. Various fidelity simulators, including a pseudo-photo-realistic Gazebo simulator, are developed alongside a functional real world platform for testing load pose estimation methods. A novel cable-based testing apparatus that enables drone translation is used to facilitate stability testing of a quasi-static formation control method for lifting a slung load. This work aims to be the first to use visual feedback to estimate a load\u2019s pose in a multi-drone slung load system operating without external motion capture devices. In simulation, perspective-n-point-based visual estimation achieves position errors of 0.1 m, and geodesic distance attitude errors around 0 \u25e6 . Real world testing shows errors of 0.2 m and 5 \u25e6 respectively. Applying extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter formulations, simulated position estimates average around an error of 0 m, while the error noise magnitude is only 6% of the cable length at 0.06 m. Achieving accurate load pose estimates without an inertial measurement unit mounted to the load requires a good cable dynamics model. This work concludes by presenting a novel model for the effect of cables in a drone-slung-load system. A method based on universal differential equations shows promising early results."

    "This thesis introduces and uses a standardized method for assessing machine connectivity at manufacturing facilities and develops a roadmap for an organization looking to implement connectivity at its facilities. As technology rapidly advances and Industry 4.0 takes hold of manufacturing worldwide, it is essential for manufacturing companies to utilize the latest technology to maintain a competitive advantage by optimizing operations, improving productivity, and increasing throughput. In this work, an overview of machine connectivity and its benefits are presented, and technologies and security measures used for connectivity are explored. Upon compilation of this information, a comprehensive rubric was developed with six weighted connectivity criteria, each scored from 0 (no progress) to 4 (fully complete), from which a total connectivity score can be computed. The rubric serves as a guiding tool for gauging a manufacturing facility\u2019s level of maturity with regards to connectivity, and helps identify areas of need both within a facility and within an organization as a whole. The connectivity levels of six different manufacturing facilities were assessed using the rubric. The results were compiled to understand the development of connectivity at different facilities across the organization. The learnings from this analysis are used to develop guidelines as the organization continues its push towards full connectivity across all of its facilities. The next steps in this initiative are to: 1) utilize the developed rubric to assess connectivity at all of its manufacturing facilities, 2) identify facilities in need of the most resources in order to plan and execute connectivity, and 3) encourage collaboration between facilities to expedite the connectivity implementation process."

    "Inosine is a nucleoside formed by deamination of adenosine by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR). ADAR editing activity is known to play a key role in modulating the host cell\u2019s immune response to RNA. Here, we specifically study the effect of the presence of inosine in RNA by generating an inosine-containing reporter mRNA sequence. We also generated mRNA sequences that contained pseudouridine, an RNA modification known to decrease immune response to in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA and elevate the expression of the encoded gene, to examine the interaction between pseudouridine and inosine modifications. \r\nWhile A-to-I editing activity is required for endogenous RNA to evade the innate immune response, our results show that inosine-containing IVT RNA induces an elevated immune response and is translated at a lower efficiency. This effect is dominant over pseudouridine modification, such that mRNAs containing both pseudouridine and inosine modifications still potently activate the innate immune response and exhibit a loss of translation. These results point to the potent immunostimulatory effects of inosine in transfected IVT mRNA. This elevated immune response is likely receptor-specific and we have demonstrated that it cannot be attributed to the sensors RIG-I, MDA5, TLR3, or PKR."

    "This research explores the innovative application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models, in designing culturally sensitive hospitals for rural Kenya. The research addresses the critical need for improved healthcare infrastructure in underserved areas, focusing on the potential of AI to create efficient, adaptable, and contextually appropriate hospital designs. The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative analysis of cultural practices and healthcare needs with quantitative data on environmental factors and health statistics. A GPT model is developed and fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset of Kenyan cultural information, healthcare data, and architectural knowledge. This AI model is then used to generate hospital design concepts that are evaluated against newly developed cultural sensitivity metrics. Key findings demonstrate the potential of AI to significantly reduce design time, improve space utilization, and enhance cultural appropriateness in hospital designs. The thesis also highlights the importance of human-AI collaboration, with local experts and community representatives playing crucial roles in refining and implementing AI-generated concepts. Challenges identified include data quality and availability in rural settings, the need for ongoing model refinement, and the importance of establishing ethical guidelines for AI use in healthcare design. The thesis concludes with a set of recommendations for implementing AI-driven, culturally sensitive hospital design processes in rural Kenya, including the development of specialized AI models, and establishment of collaborative design methodologies. These findings have significant implications for improving healthcare infrastructure in resource-constrained settings and offer a model for culturally sensitive, AI-driven architectural design in developing contexts globally."

    "Nano-engineered oxides play a frontier role in the development of next-generation catalysts and microelectronics. Recently, metal exsolution from oxides has emerged as a promising nano-structuring tool to fabricate nanoparticle-decorated oxides. However, controlling the size, density, composition, and location of exsolved nanoparticles remains a challenge, limiting the ultimate performance achievable by these nanostructures. Here, we present ion irradiation as a general platform to allow control over these parameters during metal nanoparticle exsolution, by simultaneous sputtering, implantation, and defect generation mechanisms. Using thin-film perovskite and binary oxides as model systems, we showed ion beams can controllably reduce the size of exsolved nanoparticles down to 2 nm through ion sputtering. Meanwhile, we tailored the exsolved nanoparticle composition from unitary metal to metal alloy via ion implantation. Furthermore, irradiation creates point defects and defect clusters, which serve as nucleation sites for metal exsolution. By leveraging this process, we tuned the density and spatial distribution of exsolved nanoparticles. Finally, we demonstrated that nanocatalysts prepared by irradiation-assisted exsolution exhibit superior catalytic activity toward water-splitting reactions than those produced using conventional exsolution methods. These findings highlight the potential of ion irradiation for engineering nanoparticle exsolution in diverse materials systems, with broad implications for electrochemical and electronic applications."
